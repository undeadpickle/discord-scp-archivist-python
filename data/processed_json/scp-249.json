  "content": "Item #: SCP-249\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedure: SCP-249 is affixed to a wall within Site-\u2588\u2588. Access to SCP-249 is unrestricted, though an accurate log of destinations must be kept and submitted to a Level-4 supervisor every four (4) weeks. No SCPs of any class may be brought or kept within one thousand (1000) meters of SCP-249 without Level-4 approval.\nDescription: SCP-249 appears to be a windowless door, covered in a faded white paint. It was first found in a house located within the small town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. When opened, SCP-249 does not lead to the other side of the doorway, but to a random door within eight hundred and fifty (850) meters. Items that go through SCP-249 are teleported to that other door, regardless of what may be between the door and SCP-249. When observed from the destination, the exit door appears to open on its own accord, and whatever goes through SCP-249 appears out of thin air. When opened, SCP-249 takes on the appearance of the door it is connected to. When shut, SCP-249 is no longer connected to that door, and reverts to its standard appearance.\nHowever, roughly every five hundred (500) uses, SCP-249 does not connect to a door within its range, but instead to a random location anywhere in the world, even locations with no apparent doors within hundreds of kilometers. When the 500-use mark approaches, common use of SCP-249 is stopped and tests are done to record its exit location. Since its discovery, a log has been kept documenting these cases (See Addendum 249-001).\nDocument 249-A\nIn accordance to O5-\u2588\u2588, all restrooms have been moved away from SCP-249's range.\nAddendum 249-001 Teleportation log.\n12-10-19\u2588\u2588: SCP-249 is found and moved to Site \u2588\u2588.\n24-6-19\u2588\u2588: Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 goes missing and is found weeks later in eastern Canada; describes random transportation.\n17-10-20\u2588\u2588: Middle of what appears to be the Sahara desert.\n4-12-20\u2588\u2588: Warehouse in a destroyed city resembling \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n25-2-20\u2588\u2588: Madagascar.\n17-5-20\u2588\u2588: When opened, SCP-249 releases a massive torrent of water. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was holding the door handle, shuts the SCP before Site \u2588\u2588 is flooded. Later, a fish found on the ground is examined, and identified as a species living only in the Mid-Atlantic Deep Sea Trench.\n22-10-20\u2588\u2588: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n19-11-20\u2588\u2588: Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 requests use of SCP-249 in infiltration mission. Request approved. Mission is successful.\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-249\" by Dr Gerald, from the SCP Wiki.
