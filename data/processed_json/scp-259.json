  "content": "Item #: SCP-259\nObject Class: Keter\nSpecial Containment Procedures: A single copy of a computer program capable of producing SCP-259 is to be kept on compact disc in the High Security Containment Vault at Site-25. As discs containing SCP-259 are typically destroyed during experimentation, additional copies may be made for approved experiments.\nMobile Task Force Gamma-10 remains on standby to collect and neutralize any copies of SCP-259 found outside the Foundation. Unauthorized media containing SCP-259 or the means to produce it are to be destroyed immediately.\nDescription: SCP-259 is a fractal image known as \"The Weisenglass Spiral\". A completed rendering of SCP-259 acts as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, opening a portal to an unknown location. The locations accessed appear to vary depending on the size and orientation of the rendered image, and have included:\n\nAn area filled with superheated plasma (estimated temperature 20,000,000 Kelvin). See Incident K-259-1.\nAn area populated with venomous cockroaches (species unknown; weight approximately 2\u00a0kg). See Incident K-259-2.\nDeep space, estimated to be [REDACTED] km from a black hole. See Experiment X-259-2.\nAn area possibly corresponding to the dimension opened by SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. See Experiment X-259-3.\n\nFoundation mathematicians are working on determining why this specific fractal has anomalous properties, and whether other similarly anomalous images exist. By O5 order, any image rendering related to SCP-259 experimentation must take place at least \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 m from inhabited areas.\nAfter Incident K-259-1, 41 copies of a CD capable of generating SCP-259 were confiscated from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com, and a public warning issued that the CD, labeled \u201c100 Fun Fractals You Can Print,\u201d contains a malicious virus that will destroy the user\u2019s computer. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com claimed to have obtained the disks from a reseller's bankruptcy sale, and the Foundation was unable to trace the original producer. Whether SCP-259 was released accidentally, or distributed with knowledge of its anomalous properties, is under investigation.\nIncident K-259-2 makes it clear that SCP-259 is being used with malicious intent. The Foundation is working with global anti-terrorism forces to retrieve SCP-259 from the organization responsible for this incident.\nAddendum:\nIncident K-259-1 \u2013 A residence hall at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 University was destroyed by explosion/fire on \u2588/\u2588/20\u2588\u2588. Authorities were mystified that conditions at the center of the incident resembled the detonation of a small fusion-based device. Graduate student \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was completely vaporized, as were \u2588\u2588 others, including several who left shadows imprinted on the nearest standing walls. Questioning of survivors indicated that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had gone to his room with a CD he had recently ordered from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com \u201cto play with some fractals\u201d, leading to the eventual discovery of a program capable of rendering SCP-259 for sale on the site.\nIncident K-259-2 \u2013 \u2588/\u2588\u2588/201\u2588: Image of SCP-259, approximately 10\u00a0m x 10\u00a0m in size, appears on Diamond Vision screen during soccer game at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Stadium, outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Approximately 60,000 people in attendance. Survivors report a large circular anomaly appeared in front of the image, and venomous cockroaches \"poured out\" from it, attacking anyone they could reach. Approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 casualties. Considered a self-containing incident as the insects are unable to survive for more than two hours in Earth's atmosphere.\nThe cockroaches average 2\u00a0kg in weight, and correspond to no known terrestrial species; several live specimens were collected by Foundation MTFs and classified as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. They are currently held at Site-\u2588\u2588 in a 35% oxygen environment. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 organization later claimed responsibility for the image. Mass application of amnestics necessary to partially suppress public knowledge of this event.\nExperiment X-259-1 \u2014 A battery-powered computer was set up in an uninhabited area of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Desert to render an image of the Weisenglass Spiral, with remote cameras and sensors set up to monitor the results. Foundation personnel observed at a safe distance. Upon completion of the image, a circular area appeared in front of the computer, approximately 1\u00a0m in diameter, emitting a blinding white light followed by a ball of superheated plasma. The plasma dissipated after expanding to an area of \u2588\u2588\u2588 cubic meters. Given the interference provided by the building in Incident K-259-1, this is consistent with the damage observed.\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 considers it interesting that SCP-259 took effect without direct human observation.\nExperiment X-259-2 \u2014 Experiment X-259-1 re-created, except the size of the rendered fractal was doubled. Upon completion of image, a black portal approximately 3\u00a0m in diameter appeared, and all matter within \u2588\u2588\u2588 m was pulled into it. This is consistent with an otherwise unexplained incident in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, where an apartment building was described by observers as imploding and disappearing, leaving a \u2588\u2588\u2588 m deep hole.\nExperiment X-259-3 \u2013 Generation of an inverted version of SCP-259. [DATA EXPUNGED] and area quarantined pending containment of multiple examples of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-259\" by eric_h, from the SCP Wiki.
