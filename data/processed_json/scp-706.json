  "content": "Item #: SCP-706\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-706 is to be housed in a humanoid containment cell at Humanoid Containment Site-06-3 which has been modified with padded walls and minimal sharp edges. SCP-706 is to be provided with 1.2\u00a0kg of kaolin and ceramic glaze daily in addition to its regular diet.\nHandling personnel are allowed to provide SCP-706 with non-standard items such as vanity mirrors, extra clothing as outlined in Document 706-E, and a paintbrush set with ceramic enamel paint as an incentive or reward for good behavior.\nSCP-706 is currently contained under suicide watch procedures and is to be restrained at all times except when undergoing testing. SCP-706 is to be given daily therapy sessions until further notice.\nDescription: SCP-706 is an adolescent European-American female identified as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, twelve years of age according to local records at time of initial containment. Records also indicate that SCP-706 had been home-schooled throughout its life and that neighbors rarely saw SCP-706 outdoors.\nSCP-706 is physiologically normal with the exception of an abnormally high resting body temperature of approximately 38.5\u00b0C and that its entire epidermis is composed of porcelain, with the exception of small areas around its joints. This layer is extremely fragile due to its thickness and can crack or break when subjected to impacts or even with excessive movement, a process that is reportedly extremely painful. SCP-706 is capable of regenerating this skin layer at a rate consistent with normal skin growth when provided with and allowed to consume appropriate raw materials. Unfinished materials such as kaolin are acceptable and preferred; SCP-706 has no particular resistance to tissue damage resulting from the ingestion of hardened porcelain.\nUnless otherwise directed, SCP-706 will compulsively maintain its appearance, typically involving looking at itself in mirrors and using any available makeup or paint to apply, remove, or adjust its features. SCP-706 will become distressed and uncooperative if not provided appropriate materials with which to maintain its materials or if denied the ability to inspect its own appearance.\nSCP-706 was recovered from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Texas following a police report involving a violent domestic dispute at a suburban residence. SCP-706 was discovered in a back room of the residence surrounded by a large pile of destroyed remains from several dozen porcelain dolls and multiple sets of fine china dinnerware, with most of the porcelain mass having been consumed. Class A amnestics were administered to responding law enforcement personnel and a cover story given to local media.\nAddendum 706-1: Recording Transcript\nThe following audio recording was taken from a damaged digital camcorder found within the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 residence.\n\n(Irrelevant content redacted for brevity.)\nMrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Okay, sweetie, one more time, okay?\n(slamming sound, presumed to be a door)\nMr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: (slurred) I have had enough of your goddamn caterwauling.

She has also taken to intentionally breaking off pieces of her skin in order to remove undesired features, a practice that is beginning to seriously threaten her health.\nA revision to containment procedures to reflect this self-destructive behavior has been filed with site administration and is currently under review.\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-706\" by Aelanna, from the SCP Wiki.
