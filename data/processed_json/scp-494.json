  "content": "Item #: SCP-494\nObject Class: Safe\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-494 does not require any special containment procedures, other than being kept under lock and key in Storage Bunker \u2588\u2588 at Site \u2588\u2588. Level 2 clearance and written permission from a Level 4 or higher researcher is required for testing procedures regarding SCP-494.\nDescription: SCP-494 appears to be a regular pair of black leather fingerless gloves. SCP-494\u2019s anomalous features can only be observed while worn by a human subject. Upon being fitted onto the hand, SCP-494 will change size to match that of its wearer. Test subjects have described the feeling of wearing the gloves as if they were \u201cnot wearing gloves at all\u201d.\nSCP-494\u2019s true anomalous nature is revealed in that when an object is held in each gloved hand, after exactly five minutes, the two objects\u2019 makeup will be suddenly traded. The range of materials that can be transferred as yet seems to have no limit, and has been observed to create working machines and even living organisms from the materials provided. (see Test Log for details)\nSCP-494 seems to have some limitations, such as the fact that only objects that can be supported by the wearers strength (artificial assistance, such as leaning one\u2019s hands against a wall or table, seems to negate the effects of the gloves) will be transformed, and for reasons unknown, the gloves will refuse to work when worn by a subject over the age of sixty (60).\nTesting Log\nTest Format:\nMaterials:\nRight hand:\nLeft hand:\nResult:\nRight hand:\nLeft hand:\n\nTest 494-1\nMaterials:\nRight hand: One (1) 0.24 carat diamond\nLeft hand: One (1) Regular golf ball\nResult:\nRight hand: One (1) diamond-shaped piece of plastic\nLeft hand: One (1) rounded crystal formation, two (2) inches in diameter. Diffractometry confirms monocrystalline diamond.\n\n\nTest 494-2\nMaterials:\nRight hand: One (1) Nokia flip-cover cellular phone\nLeft hand: Two (2) stainless steel razor blades\nResult:\nRight hand: One (1) hinged stainless steel box with acid-etched surfaces denoting a cellphone keypad.\nLeft hand: Two (2) millimeter-thick machines with small screens and microscopic computer circuitry. Found to be fully functional as cellular phones.\n\n\nTest 494-3\nMaterials:\nRight hand: One (1) white laboratory rat\nLeft hand: One (1) 1974 penny\nResult:\nRight hand: One (1) copper statuette of a rat\nLeft hand: One (1) small, disk-shaped organism with white fur. Though lacking sensory organs or any observed lungs or digestive system, organism is entirely viable and responds to external stimuli such as light and pain.\n\n\nTest 494-4\nMaterials:\nRight hand: One (1) vial containing live streptococcus bacteria\nLeft hand: One (1) white laboratory rat\nResult:\nRight hand: One (1) vial containing animal cells with DNA of rat\nLeft hand: No observable difference aside from a slight change in the hue of the animal's fur. However, after further observation, the resulting animal proved to be capable of asexual reproduction; it proceeded to give birth to seventy-seven young within an hour, without any indication of stopping. Resulting offspring grew rapidly, maturing within a half-hour. Mature offspring in turn produced their own offspring. All animals were subsequently incinerated. Estimations of rate of reproduction suggest over one hundred thousand (100,000) young would have been produced within a day.\nNote: All tests involving the effects of SCP-494 on live microorganisms are now strictly prohibited.\n\nAddendum 494-1: Suggestions for testing the effects of SCP-494 on SCP-500 in conjunction with other materials are currently pending approval.\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-494\" by Chungy McBungy, from the SCP Wiki.
