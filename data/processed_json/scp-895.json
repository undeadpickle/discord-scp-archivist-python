  "content": "Item #: SCP-895\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-895 is sealed, closed and stored in an isolated underground containment cell at a depth of approximately 100 meters. No cameras, microphones, or other surveillance equipment may be brought within the 10 meter \"Red Zone\" radius of SCP-895 without express permission from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel.\nAny on-site personnel exhibiting unusual behavior or signs of psychological trauma are to be screened immediately, and removed from the site or terminated as the situation warrants.\nDescription: SCP-895 is an ornate oak coffin recovered from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Mortuary by SCP personnel on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588, following reports of unusual footage captured by surveillance equipment installed at that location. When questioned, mortuary staff were unable to determine the source of SCP-895 and how it was transported to the location. Upon attempting to open SCP-895, agents on location found the object empty; however, observers viewing the live camera feed were [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until further notice, SCP-895 must remain closed at all times.\nSCP-895 causes disruptions in video and photographic surveillance equipment within 50 meters similar to vivid, disturbing hallucinations with variable duration and regularity corresponding to the camera's proximity to SCP-895. Within a range of 5 meters from SCP-895, footage captured can cause severe psychological trauma and hysteria in most subjects. These disruptions do not extend to observers physically present within the area.\nAddendum 895-01: Audio excerpt from the SCP-895 Recovery Log (\u2588\u2588/\u2588/\u2588\u2588)\n\n03:41L - Command: Team One, Command.

Video feed check.\n03:44L - Command: Team One, Command. We are receiving\u2026[pause]\u2026we are seeing blood on the walls, please confirm.\n03:44L - T1Lead: Negative, Command, it's clean in here. Nothing out of the ordinary.\n03:45L - Command: \u2026 it's gone. Team One, advise possible memetic properties in effect.\n03:45L - T1Lead: Copy, Command. Team One moving into storage area.\n03:47L - T1Lead: We are in the storage area, object located.\n03:48L - Command: Christ, it's moving\u2026 Team One, confirm, object appears to be alive and moving.\n03:48L - T1Lead: \u2026 Command, negative, we see no movement. Object appears to be normal.\n03:48L - T1Lead: Two, open it up.\n03:48L - Sounds of weapons being readied, followed by creaking as object is opened.\n03:49L - T1-2: Sir, it's empty.\n03:50L - T1Lead: Command, One Lead. The object appears to be empty.\n03:51L - T1Lead: Command, do you copy?\n03:51L - Command: Sounds of screaming and retching.\n03:51L - T1Lead: Command, do you copy?!\n03:52L - T1Lead: Shit, we're bugging out. Close that thing!\n\nAddendum 895-02: Following Incident [DATA EXPUNGED] and the loss of 3 personnel, the Red Zone of SCP-895 has been extended from 5 meters to 10 meters, and security personnel shifts have been reduced to 4 hours as a precaution.\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-895\" by Aelanna, from the SCP Wiki.
