  "content": "Item #: SCP-400\n\n\nEuclid\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures:\nThe single colony of SCP-400 in Foundation custody (designation SCP-400-B) is currently housed in a juvenile humanoid containment cell at Site-77\u2019s Euclid objects wing. Any cell containing an active SCP-400 colony must be secured with an air-lock door under Bio-safety Level 4 precautions. Any openings for ventilation must be covered by a metal screen with gaps no greater than 0.2\u00a0cm in diameter, followed by aerosol filter 400-AF to be changed monthly and remanded to on-site chemical research personnel with Level 3/400 clearance. Access for experimentation purposes requires approval from both the Ethics Committee and the item's acting HMCL supervisor (currently Dr. Marshall Grant). SCP-400 handlers are required to wear Level 4 positive pressure Bio-hazard suits, and must be decontaminated prior to egress. In emergency situations, prevention of olfactory contact with SCP-400 is sufficient to prevent accidental exposure in most cases. For care-giving instructions, please refer to Document 400-C rev 1.3.\nAgents operating in the continental United States are to report any statistically significant drop in daycare, preschool, and primary school enrollment in their assigned region. Elements of MTF Beta-7 (\u201cMaz Hatters\u201d) are to remain on-call for identification, research, and termination of active SCP-400 infestations. Locations found to be infested are to be quarantined using cover story 139-B (\u2018bubonic plague\u2019). Media inquiries are to be categorically denied, and all agents of the press demonstrating interest in the quarantine are to be detained and administered a Class B amnestic prior to release.\nFoundation personnel affected by SCP-400 are subject to quarantine of up to three (3) weeks. If by this time anomalous effects have subsided, personnel are subject to psychological evaluation prior to return to duty. If anomalous effects are still present after the administration of a Class A amnestic, remaining personnel may be reassigned to non-anomalous research, administrative, and medical positions. Civilians exposed are to be administered a Class A amnestic prior to release. Please refer to Document 400-1R for reintegration instructions by geographic region. Damage control for infestations affecting population centers of 500 persons or more may employ amnestic agent Ennui-02 locally if necessary.\nAt least one active SCP-400 colony must be collected from all subsequent infestations, and remanded to genetic research personnel with Level 3/400 clearance.\n\nDescription:\nSCP-400 is the collective designation for an anomalous species of arthropod similar to Armadillidium vulgare, or the common pill bug. SCP-400 individuals are morphologically similar to A. vulgare in appearance, but can be distinguished visually by bright red striping patterns on their dorsal carapace. Visual identification is only possible by individuals not under the influence of SCP-400\u2019s anomalous effects. SCP-400 is a parasitic organism which feeds on human mammary secretions. Access to this food source is gained by habitation and manipulation of deceased human infants.\nAffected persons are subject to a Type 3 cognitohazard via a pheromone vector, which repurposes the natural child-rearing instincts present in all humans for its own feeding and protection. Those subject to this effect are unable to perceive SCP-400 or the damage it causes to infants. Exposure to D-Class assets has determined that the effect does not apply to video or audio surveillance, and that Level 4 Biohazard precautions are sufficient in preventing the effects\u2019 onset. Personnel briefed on SCP-400\u2019s effects show no special immunity to the false perceptions created by the anomaly.\nAs of 14/07/2005, the Ethics Committee has determined that future human experimentation with SCP-400 will only be allowed in unique and dire circumstances. As such, all information regarding SCP-400\u2019s relationship with humans and life cycle have been compiled from extensive surveillance and interviews conducted in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, the site of SCP-400\u2019s discovery. Conclusions are based on an observational period from August 2003 through July 2005.\nInfestation begins when twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) instances of SCP-400 select an infant1 and access its crib. Observation has failed to detect any instance of SCP-400 prior to appearance within the target crib. Parents and D-Class personnel present will be unable to perceive SCP-400. If any person passes within 0.5\u00a0m of the infant, SCP-400 instances will collectively release a fine spray, which causes immediate disorientation and rapid loss of consciousness.\nSCP-400 will then begin to burrow into the flesh of the sleeping infant. Favored points of entry include the mouth, eyes, anus, navel, and armpits. The infant will not react to the presence of SCP-400 in any fashion, suggesting the use of local anesthetics. Cardiopulmonary activity in the infant will cease within the first forty (40) minutes of this procedure, and within three (3) to five (5) hours, movement will resume, followed by strained vocalizations. At this point, the infant is considered an \u2018active colony\u2019 of SCP-400. Incapacitated subjects will awaken soon after the first vocalization and investigate. Parents or other adults present within ear-shot will also show interest as per normal for distressed infant vocalization. If the original mother of the colony is present at this time, she will immediately begin breastfeeding regardless of previous feeding schedule or practices.\nOver roughly the next ten (10) weeks, parents and other adults begin to show increased affection and protectiveness toward the colony. During this stage, direct observation by present adults and children will be unable to detect any abnormalities in the colony\u2019s physiology, despite numerous dermal perforations and jerky, unnatural movement. The colony is capable of basic vocalization, and is able to emulate feeding, defecation, and play behaviors of normal infants with increasing proficiency. Decomposition is still visible via surveillance during this time, culminating in desiccation of the colony\u2019s remaining soft tissues2.\nBy the end of the twelfth (12th) week, all observed colonies exhibited increased size, such that individual instances of SCP-400 are visible moving under the skin. Such colonies are considered \u2018mature\u2019, and individual instances will begin reproductive behavior during this period. During feeding, seven (7) to twelve (12) SCP-400 individuals will exit the colony through one of its dermal perforations, and take hold of any exposed portion of the host mother\u2019s skin for approximately 10 min before returning. Host mothers studied during this time begin to show increased progesterone production, as well as heightened levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, indicating an induced pregnancy. After an incubation period of two (2) to three (3) days, host mothers will \u2018birth\u2019 twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) instances of SCP-400 during her next sleep. Instances of SCP-400 have not been successfully tracked after birth. Maximum interval of dormancy before SCP-400 must initiate another infestation is unknown. After breeding behavior begins, the cycle will repeat once weekly for the duration of the infestation. No natural limit to SCP-400 infestation timeline has been observed. (See Addendum 400-02)\nOf \u2588\u2588\u2588 recorded infestations to date, all have occurred in the south-eastern United States in rural or mountainous areas, and in some cases have gone unnoticed for as long as nine (9) months. Improved detection and extermination of SCP-400 instances is considered a high research priority.\n\nAddendum 400-01: Interview 400-25\n\nForeword: Twenty-fifth in a series of interviews conducted during the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588 infestation of 2003. Mrs. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (hereafter \u2018Mrs. B.\u2019) interviewed by Dr. Marshall Grant, Agent Fabian Pertucci observing. Mrs. B has served as host-mother to SCP-400-A and SCP-400-B simultaneously. The advanced state of decomposition suggests the colonies had been active for over two years. She and her deceased twins are considered strong candidates for \u2018Patient SCP-400-0\u2019. At the time of interview, Mrs. B was isolated from SCP-400 for fifteen (15) days. Interview conducted on 10/7/2005.\nDr. Grant: Good afternoon \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, how are we feeling today?\nMrs. B: Where are my babies? What have you done with my babies?\nDr. Grant: Your children are being treated for possible bubonic plague exposure, ma\u2019am. They will be returned to you as soon as possible.\nMrs. B: [subject strikes table] Oh that\u2019s bullshit! You can\u2019t keep them from me. You have no right to keep a mother from her children! Tell me where they are or so help me when my husband\u2019s lawyers hear of this\u2014\nDr. Grant: Mrs. B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, we\u2019re on your side here. We want to help. If you\u2019ll just answer a few questions for me, we\u2019ll do everything we can to let you see them this afternoon.\nMrs. B: I\u2019ve already told you on the form. They\u2019re three months old, male, [NAMES REDACTED], identical twins, weigh about 10 pounds, they don\u2019t have any allergies. What more do you want from me?\nDr. Grant: You said three months old? When were they born?\nMrs. B: February 5, 2003. Now will you-! \u2026 I'm sorry, I'm just\u2026 I love them so much. Never thought I would be much of a mother but they have been such a joy! After my husband died\u2026[subject is silent for 15 seconds] \u2026they mean the world to me! I don't know what I would do without them. Not a day goes by I don\u2019t feel blessed.\nDr. Grant: I imagine you must. For the record, you\u2019re aware of today\u2019s date?\nMrs. B: It\u2019s July the 10th two thousand fuh\u2026 Huh\u2026 Well that\u2019s funny. I could have sworn they were only three months. My, time does fly! I must have a picture of them here somewhere.[subject accesses personal effects and produces a portrait of SCP-400-A and SCP-400-B prior to infestation]Here it is! Aren\u2019t they just so beautiful?\nDr. Grant: Yes, ma\u2019am. Now, has there been anything peculiar about your boys?\nMrs. B: Well there was that time in May when that doctor\u2026 No, nothing at all! If anything they\u2019re doing too well! So healthy and full of life. I swear little [REDACTED] said \u2018Ma-ma\u2019 just yesterday!\nDr. Grant: I\u2019m sorry, what was that about a doctor?\nMrs. B: Yes, he came to the house after they\u2026[three second pause, subject visibly confused] I didn\u2019t say anything about a doctor! Let me see my children, please. They\u2019re probably starving by now; they need to be fed.\nAgent Pertucci (inaudible to Mrs. B): We\u2019re losing her; come back to it.\nDr. Grant: I assure you, ma\u2019am, we\u2019re giving them the best care possible.\nMrs. B: With that awful formula, I\u2019ll bet! [REDACTED] threw up the last time I tried that. Neither of them has touched it since. No; it\u2019s natural breast milk for them, 100%. My obstetrician said that they\u2019ll need it for at least another three months, and I\u2019m not about to take any risks.\nDr. Grant: Isn\u2019t two and a half years a little long to be breastfeeding?\nMrs. B: They\u2019re\u2026 they\u2019re only three months old!\nDr. Grant: But just now, you had said\u2014\nMrs. B: I know what I said! It\u2019s your fault. Got my head all turned around!\nDr. Grant: I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve confused you, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s just\u2014\nMrs. B: Who the hell are you people, anyway? Let me see my babies!\n\nAt this point in the interview, Mrs. B refused to answer any further questions, and exhibited increased emotional distress and separation anxiety. Post-interview medical examination revealed extensive ovarian/uterine trauma in excess of all other host mothers examined. Mrs. B was administered a Class A amnestic when observations were concluded, and is currently under Foundation surveillance as a Person of Interest.\n\nAddendum 400-02:\nAs of 14/7/2010, SCP-400-A and SCP-400-B have been active in Foundation custody for five (5) years, indicating that colonies may be able to survive indefinitely if continually provided with food. Level 4 Bio-hazard precautions have successfully prevented not only reproduction of SCP-400, but also the spread of all cognitohazardous effects within Site-77. Limited access for experimentation may be granted with approval from the Ethics Committee and SCP-400\u2019s HMCL supervisor (currently Dr. Grant). Please allow up to thirty (30) days for review prior to beginning any new line of experimentation.\n\nAddendum 400-03:\nOn 5/10/2010, SCP-400-A ceased activity while in containment after ingesting an experimental nutritional supplement, allowing medical examiners to dissect the colony. Despite desiccation and decomposition, muscle tissues remain responsive to electric stimulus. Highest concentrations of SCP-400 can be found in the stomach, mouth, brain case, and spinal column. Of particular note is the presence of individual specimens periodically along major motor nerves in the extremities, indicating an unprecedented level of communal intellect utilizing the infant's extant neural architecture.\nExamination of the pheromones produced by individual SCP-400 instances has revealed several hallucinogenic, amnestic, and soporific compounds which are capable of reproducing SCP-400\u2019s cognitohazardous effects. Analysis of several compounds has revealed similarities to Class B and C amnestics currently in use by the Foundation, indicating a possible security breach (minimal risk). Aerosol concentrations of the mixture as low as 50ppm have proven effective in initiating the effect. Further research into the genetic sequencing of SCP-400 is recommended.\n\nFootnotes\n1. Precise criteria for this selection is unknown. In the seven (7) colonies observed from inception, infant targets were between three (3) weeks and two (2) months of age. Upper and lower age bounds for infestation have not been established.\n2. It is presumed that the final desiccation is an adaptation of SCP-400, developed to ensure the colony\u2019s continued structural integrity\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-400\" by HammerMaiden, from the SCP Wiki.
