  "content": "Item #: SCP-682\nObject Class: Keter\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-682 must be destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682, only able to cause massive physical damage. SCP-682 should be contained within a 5\u00a0m x 5\u00a0m x 5\u00a0m chamber with 25\u00a0cm reinforced acid-resistant steel plate lining all inside surfaces. The containment chamber should be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-682 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempts of SCP-682 to move, speak, or breach containment should be reacted to quickly and with full force as called for by the circumstances.\nPersonnel are forbidden to speak to SCP-682, for fear of provoking a rage-state. All unauthorized personnel attempting to communicate to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force.\nDue to its frequent attempts at containment breach, difficulty of containment and incapacitation, and high threat of Foundation Exposure, SCP-682 is to be contained in site [REDACTED]. The Foundation will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of human development.\nDescription: SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with SCP-079 during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B).\nSCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682's physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material. SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. Digestion seems to be aided by a set of filtering gills inside of SCP-682's nostrils, which are able to remove usable matter from any liquid solution, enabling it to constantly regenerate from the acid it is contained in. SCP-682's regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed or rotted.\nIn case of containment breach, SCP-682 is to be tracked and re-captured by all available Mobile Task Forces, and no teams with fewer than seven (7) members are cleared to engage it. To date (\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum 682-D).\n\nAddendum 682-B: Portion of recorded transcript of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n<Begin Log, skip to 00h-21m-52s>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Now, why did you kill those farmers?\nSCP-682: (No verbal communication)\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: If you don't talk now, we will remove you from this attempt and place you back into-\nSCP-682: (Incomprehensible)\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Pardon?

General \u2588\u2588\u2588, General \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 observing.\n\n0400: Exposure. SCP-682 began to tear at the point of contact, causing massive trauma to the area. SCP-682 requests several times to know what it has been exposed to.\n0800: Crystallization begins, spreading much slower than normal.\n1200: SCP-682 shows signs of extreme pain, and begins having seizures\n1300: Crystallization stops at 62% conversion. Crystallized area explodes, causing massive physical trauma to SCP-682\n1400: SCP-682 recovers from exposure, despite the loss of limbs and organs. SCP-682 begins regeneration, stating that it will attempt to kill and consume all staff involved in Event 682-E18.\n\nSCP-682 appears to now be immune to SCP-409. Use of other SCP items to terminate SCP-682 must now first be tested on samples of SCP-682 before full-scale testing.\nIn accordance the Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's recommendations (see Document 27b-6), Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have requested permission to attempt the termination of SCP-682 using SCP-689. The request is currently pending approval from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\nIt has also been suggested by Dr. Gears to use SCP-182 in an attempt to communicate with SCP-682. SCP-182 has expressed reluctance, and refuses to enter the containment center of SCP-682, if at all possible.\n\nAddendum 682-F: Termination Log:\nExperiment-Log-T-98816-oc108-682\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-682\" by Dr Gears and Epic Phail Spy, from the SCP Wiki.
