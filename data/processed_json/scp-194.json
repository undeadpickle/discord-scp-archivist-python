  "content": "Item #: SCP-194\nObject Class: Safe\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-194 is contained in a standard anomalous vehicle containment unit.\nDescription: SCP-194 is a red-painted rowboat, designed to seat two people.\n\nAddenda\u00a0194.A-194.C:\u00a0Documentation\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-194-Z\n\nClose\n\nAddendum 194.A (Object Class): Euclid\nAddendum 194.B (Special Containment Procedures): The object presently designated SCP-194 is contained in a concrete mausoleum located in a New Orleans cemetery, the location of which is included in attached file 194-LOC-A. The mausoleum is to be checked for damage or deterioration once every 30 days. Any reality-restructuring effects of SCP-194 which appear to impact the space outside of it should be reported to containment staff.\nDue to the effects of SCP-194-Z upon the SCP-194 designation, the acting documentation of SCP-194-Z is presented in the form of various addenda to the acting SCP-194 designation. Any secondary classifications are to be assigned in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. SCP-194-Z), and all addenda are to be designated alphabetically, rather than numerically (i.e. Addendum 194.A). This is to prevent conflict with documentation applied to the SCP-194 designation.\nDespite changes to the SCP-194 designation, Addenda 194.A through 194.C describe the true nature of SCP-194-Z, and will remain unaltered regardless of other edits.\nAddendum 194.C (Description): SCP-194-Z refers to a phenomenon surrounding the SCP-194 designation. Various objects are assigned to the SCP-194 designation at various times, causing the SCP-194 file to be altered based on the affected object. Only one object can be assigned to the SCP-194 slot at any time, causing minor retroactive alterations to support the containment of each object in Foundation custody.\nNotably, most affected objects assigned to the SCP-194 designation are non-anomalous in nature.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\u00a0194.D:\u00a0CCTV\u00a0Footage\n\nClose\n\nThe following is a transcript of CCTV Recording 139-DC-732, taken 04/23/2019, in Site-139. No relevant video was recorded; only audio.\n\nSUBJECT 1: Hey.\nSUBJECT 2: Oh. Hey.\nSUBJECT 1: So, um, on Tuesday\u2014\nSUBJECT 2: Something came up.\nSUBJECT 1: Well, okay, would you like to\u2014\nSUBJECT 2: You know, I'm\u2026I'm really busy these days, it makes it kinda tough to\u2026you know. Be social.\nSUBJECT 1: Uh-huh.\nSUBJECT 2: So like, I appreciate it. Like\u2026I appreciate you\u2026my coworker, wanting to socialize with me, as coworkers, outside of work, but sometimes it's just not\u2026going to happen. You get that, right?\nSUBJECT 1: Well I mean\u2026I guess I thought\u2014\nSUBJECT 2: (Deep sigh) We are coworkers, Garth. I was under the impression this was going to be a friendly after-work chit-chat. And your texts\u2014\nSUBJECT 1: Oh, I was just\u2026playing around, ya know, it\u2014\nSUBJECT 2: No, it's not really\u2014\nSUBJECT 3: Excuse me, Laura, do you have a second?\nSUBJECT 2: Yeah.
