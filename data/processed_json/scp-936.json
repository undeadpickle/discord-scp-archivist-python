  "content": "Item #: SCP-936\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: Specimens of SCP-936 are to be kept on the grounds of Bio Research Site-104, enclosed by a fence to prevent unauthorised access, and watered daily. Approximately once a month, the plantation is to be screened for any SCP-936-1 by two (2) D-Class personnel of adequate physical ability and SCP-936-1 are to be harvested according to site plan.\nHarvested SCP-936-2 are to be incinerated if unused, can be fed to contained carnivores upon removal of seeds, which are to be incinerated.\nFollowing Incident 936-1, the D-class personnel performing the screening are to be screened thoroughly for infectious diseases, and are to use sterile gloves and facial filters to prevent contamination.\nUncontained SCP-936 instances are to be dug out and any SCP-936-1 and SCP-936-2 incinerated. For purposes of containment, the Foundation is to ensure SCP-936 is declared an invasive species by local governments; a censored description is to be made public for this purpose.\nDescription: SCP-936 is a species of deciduous, self-pollinating tree resembling Fagus sylvatica, inhabiting the region of northern and eastern Europe, most notably clustering around \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ukraine. SCP-936 is capable of forming clonal colonies, the ol[DATA EXPUNGED].\nIt has been shown that the roots of SCP-936 are host to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, similarly to the legumes - as during most of its lifecycle, the plant doesn't display any anomalous properties, checking for unusual soil nitration levels shows promise as an identification method.\nSCP-936 is monoecious, and during flowering, specimens can be recognised by an unusually high male to female flower ratio - there are only several dozen female flowers, usually growing directly on older wood. Out of those, on average, less than six continue development, and it is rare for more than a single fruit to reach maturity.\nThe resulting fruit, classified SCP-936-1 is covered in a green cupule, and rapidly grows towards its ripe mass of app. 85\u00a0kg; SCP-936's foliage grows denser in order to cover for the energetic expenditure. Dissection has revealed the inside of SCP-936-1 contains a length of stem wrapping around a structure closely resembling a human body, designated SCP-936-2. Tissue samples obtained from SCP-936-1 physiologically resemble human tissue, possessing functionality in most aspects1, with the exception of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which contain a mass of brown-black seeds approximately 3cm in diameter.\nAs SCP-936-1 reaches maturity, the stem thickens considerably and the cupule wilts, eventually breaking, and causing SCP-936-2 to descend, hanging from the stem which in most cases wraps around its cervical region.\nThe appearance of SCP-936-2 produced by a single SCP-936 varies in size, visual appearance, and apparent gender with no discernible pattern.\nThe seeds within SCP-936-2 have a thick skin, and take approximately sixteen months to germinate. However if exposed to an acidic environment (pH < 2), germination occurs within \u2588\u2588 weeks.\nRecovery Log: SCP-936 was first discovered near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Finland, after reports of an unusually high reported suicide rate. Intelligence agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's report has revealed this to be due to the statistics including a number of nude hanging victims being periodically discovered on trees in the nearby \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 forest, and the local cemetery, their identity being impossible to determine.\nSuspecting a cognitohazard, a perimeter was established around said yard under the premise of widespread bark beetle infection, and the site was placed under observation. During observation period, a new corpse was discovered despite security footage showing no violations of perimeter within assumed time of death. Autopsy revealed anomalies inconsistent with human anatomy; notably, seeds located in [REDACTED]. Agent F\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 noted that all victims have been found hanging from a single species of tree, and a thorough examination has resulted in the procurement several samples of unripe SCP-936-1, leading to SCP-936 classification.\nMTF Xi-8 \"Spearhunters\" performed removal of all instances of SCP-936 within an surrounding area of 45\u00a0km sq. Obtained seeds contained at Bio Research Site-104.\nAddendum 936-1:\n\nEXPERIMENT LOG SCP-936\nSUBJECT: D-532, 25-year-old male.\nGRAFT: 100\u00a0cm sq. of skin taken from SCP-936-2.\nRESULT: Skin graft implanted successfully. Skin shows higher mechanical resistance, possibly due to interstitial cellulose fibers. However, incisions take longer to heal, and poor resistance to UV light.\nSUBJECT: D-821, 25-year-old male.\nGRAFT: muscular tissue taken from biceps of SCP-936-2.\nRESULT: Muscle graft implanted successfully. Muscular tissue appears to behave ordinarily, and has similar strength/volume ratio. Despite D-821 being restrained for several days due to operation , implanted muscle showed no traces of atrophy. Subject D-821's diet switched to protein-deficient - measurements of rate of muscle loss showed this to be lower by a factor of \u2588\u2588.\nSUBJECT: D-231, 30-year-old male.\nGRAFT: Kidneys taken from SCP-936-2.\nRESULT: Graft implanted successfully. Kidneys shown to have remarkable liquid economy. Subject expired due to renal failure after seven weeks.\nSUBJECT: D-512, 23-year-old female.\nGRAFT: Digestive system taken from SCP-936-2.\nRESULT: Graft implanted successfully. D-512, instead of via regular digestion, appears to absorb products of bacterial decay - intestinal microflora changed substantially. D-512 appears emaciated. D-512's urine abnormal - further testing shows intestinal flora removes cca.\u2588\u2588% of urea from her bloodstream and reprocesses it.\nI suspect the new intestinal tract isn't long enough for this mode of digestion. - Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nSUBJECT: D-721, 25-year-old female.\nGRAFT: [REDACTED]\nRESULT: Graft implanted successfully. D-721 appears to produce a steady supply of seeds.\n\nSUBJECT: D-723, 31-year-old female.\nGRAFT: Subject impregnated with sperm harvested from SCP-936-1.\nRESULT: Pregnancy initially appears to progress normally. However, after \u2588\u2588 weeks, ultrasound reading [DATA EXPUNGED]01.

The infection spread through as of yet unknown means, causing a crop failure SCP-936, heavily delaying research progress. Removal of infected/dead SCP-936-1 successful in halting infection progress.\n\n\nFootnotes\n1.
