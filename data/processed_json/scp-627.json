  "content": "Item #: SCP-627\nObject Class: Safe\nSpecial Containment Procedures: One Class-D personnel, designated D-627, is to be assigned to SCP-627. This assignment is for life. As long as the Class-D is so assigned, he is rendered exempt from the monthly terminations. SCP-627 is to be kept in a stone basin, approximately one meter across. Once daily, SCP-627 is to be removed from its basin so that lubrication may be applied to the basin. Once weekly, SCP-627 is to be removed so that the basin may be inspected for wear. The basin is to be replaced if it shows signs of wearing out.\nTesting on SCP-627 is currently denied to all researchers.\nDescription: SCP-627 was brought into the Foundation in December of 1932 by Senior Researcher A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, fleeing religious persecution in Germany. Senior Researcher E\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 found SCP-627 during his work with the German government on their own SCP protocols, and felt that it could be more useful with us.\nSCP-627 is a sphere made of unknown stone, flecked with blue, of approximately three centimeters in height. When not in close (defined as skin contact, or in clothing being worn) contact with a human being, SCP-627 rolls in a circle approximately one meter across. It will not avoid inanimate obstacles, instead rolling up and over any impediments. It will never attempt to go around impediments, and, if contained in a space smaller than one meter, will increase in speed until it has worn itself a way out. When confined to a small space, SCP-627 is capable of breaking the speed of sound. When not confined, SCP-627 rolls at a speed of approximately six rotations a minute.\nNote \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/1939: We need to figure this one out.
