  "content": "Item #: SCP-224\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: Item SCP-224 is to be stored in a soundproof enclosure with acoustic destructive interference nodes. Nodes must be replaced on a weekly basis by remote means due to the erratic nature of SCP-224\u2019s effect; non Class-D personnel are not to enter the enclosure. Additionally, SCP-224\u2019s enclosure must be kept free from moisture to avoid rapid oxidation.\nIn the event that the clock begins to chime, all personnel must evacuate the area, and the location should be secured following procedure Zeit 77.\nDescription: SCP-224 is a wooden grandfather clock, accented with a black lacquer and gold leaf. Markings, remotely observed, date its origin at the end of the 19th century. Though internal examination of its components has been done, the density and construction of its gears make method of function impossible to interpret.\nThe hands of the clock do not move with any known consistency, though the tendency seems to be generally clockwise. Additionally, chimes occur at non-regular intervals, ranging from approximately one minute to several months. To further complicate matters, the numbers on the clock also have a tendency to move and shift, though they generally retain ascending order.\nEach chime has an anomalous acoustic signature that causes a drastic localized temporal acceleration. People and objects in range of the sound begin to age. The amount of time is not consistent with the chimes, ranging from essentially inconsequential amounts to several years, though the amount aged during any single event is consistent for all objects within the field of effect.\nSCP-224 was originally found in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Antique Shop and purchased by Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as a gift for his wife. When brought home and wound, the anomalous properties were noticed, though not acted upon, both apparently considering the object broken. Their bodies were discovered in their collapsed house two days later, aged significantly. Foundation personnel monitoring \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 took interest, and SCP-224 was subsequently recovered. Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were unfortunately lost following exposure during transportation.\nAny instances of SCP-224 retaining any numeric pattern for an extended period should be reported to Dr. Simmons Dr. Locke. Failure to do so will result in suspension and possible demotion.\n\nAddendum SCP-224, Cataloged Incidents:\nDue to repeated errors on the part of the maintenance crews working on containment for SCP-224, Dr. Simmons insisted that the following report be spread among the onsite work crews to fully stress the importance of SCP-224\u2019s containment. After its circulation, it was added to the primary case file for historical purposes.\n\nToday, I had the pleasure of informing Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that he is to be given retirement pay and is free to leave active duty as of this evening. It was not initially approved by Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 until I explained the circumstances.\nAgent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who is the father of Alice \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and husband of Merilee \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, was walking past the SCP-224 containment facility on Friday, March 17, 198\u2588. He was reporting to his supervisor\u2019s office to deliver the final report on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, which he was instrumental in helping acquire. Because SCP-224\u2019s effect is so unpredictable, he had no way of knowing that the object had activated until the acoustic dampening equipment failed, leading to the collapse of the wall. At this time, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was exposed to seven iterations of SCP-224\u2019s effect.\nThe first one saw him age into his mid-thirties. Those of you who have seen the video are aware that this wasn't a drastic change. However, by the second exposure, he was now well into his forties. There was significant graying of hair. By the third iteration, he was balding, and we estimate his age reached into the early sixties. By the fourth, his skin had noticeably wrinkled, with liver spots appearing in several places.\nBy the sixth iteration, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 collapsed due to a broken hip, fracturing several ribs and his left arm. It was at this time that he lost control of his bowels and bladder. When the seventh iteration ended, containment had to be manually reestablished. At this time, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is estimated to be over a hundred years old.\nAs a note, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 volunteered for termination and examination of SCP-224\u2019s effects, should the retirement pay he was now technically entitled to be rewarded to his family. I heartily thank Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for giving us this opportunity to study SCP-224\u2019s effect. I hope you\u2019ll remember in the future that, while some SCPs kill immediately, others do not. Others leave lingering effects that have ramifications for the people\u2014and the families of the people\u2014who are subjected to them.\nDr. Rasmussen was down the hall from Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. He is now a thirty-five year old man in an elderly body. Assistant Researcher Jessup, who was pregnant when she was exposed in the same incident, died when her child was forced through her abdomen. Her son is a forty year old man with the mind of an infant. Dr. Quinn's undiagnosed case of bladder cancer consumed his entire abdomen in a matter of moments.\nPlease keep these incidents in mind before failing to replace the \"perfectly fine\" acoustic nodes in the containment enclosure.\nDr. J. Simmons, Head of Containment, SCP-224\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-224\" by Unknown author, rewritten by TroyL, from the SCP Wiki.
