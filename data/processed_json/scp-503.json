  "content": "Item #: SCP-503\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-503 is to be kept within a secure holding cell at all times. No fewer than four (4) security cameras must be positioned within the cell. SCP-503 must be under constant observation. Any strange movements or attempts to obscure the view of the cameras must be treated as a full-scale emergency. Any researchers studying SCP-503 must be searched for dangerous objects before entering its cell. The cell must be searched daily for any potentially dangerous objects.\nNote on procedures: The searches are not optional. I don\u2019t care if you think they\u2019re a waste of time. I refer anyone who thinks otherwise to Incident Report 503-B. \u2014 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nDescription: SCP-503 is a Caucasian male, sixty-three (63) years of age. The subject is bald (formerly black hair) with brown eyes. The subject\u2019s lower jaw is a prosthesis, as a result of incident 503-A. There is a large scar on the subject\u2019s chest as a result of Test Log 503-5.\nSCP-503 demonstrates a remarkable proclivity toward short-term good fortune and long-term misfortune. This was first apparent at age 11, when the subject was involved in an automobile accident with its family. While the subject survived, its parents, as well as two (2) siblings died. In addition, the subject was trapped within the car for \u2588\u2588 days before rescue.\nThe subject has had three (3) marriages; the first ending in divorce; the second ending when the subject\u2019s wife was killed in an automobile accident; the third ending when the subject\u2019s wife committed suicide. During this time the subject has had ten (10) children, none of whom currently live. As far as the subject is aware, it has no living family.\nThe subject has survived falling from a 34th story window, a plane crash in the North Atlantic, two additional automobile accidents, and the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11/01. It has survived suicide attempts via hanging, overdose, self-immolation, and firearm (see Incident 503-A). Although the subject has won the lottery on two (2) separate occasions, by the time the Foundation took custody of it, medical bills had left it in heavy debt.\nSCP-503 is currently being studied by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to determine if the subject\u2019s properties can be reverse-engineered to increase the survival chances of field agents.\nIncident Report 503-A: Six (6) days before SCP-503 came into Foundation custody, it attempted suicide via shotgun. As it held the shotgun along its torso, firing up through the jaw, the jaw somehow absorbed most of the blast, destroying the jaw and causing massive cranial trauma. A neighbor who heard the blast found the subject and took it to the hospital, where it was discovered and retrieved by Foundation agents who had been monitoring the hospital for a possible outbreak of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\nIncident Report 503-B: During the experiment recorded in Test Log 503-\u2588, research assistant B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was not searched by security prior to entering the subject\u2019s cell. During the experiment, B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 left behind a ball-point pen, with which SCP-503 attempted to kill itself 31 minutes after the end of the experiment. Although it survived, it was left in critical condition for six (6) days. Research assistant B\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been disciplined and reassigned.\nTest Log 503-1\nTest: Card-based guessing game\nResult: 100% success rate\nTest Log 503-2\nTest: Game of roulette\nResult: 100% success rate\nTest Log 503-3\nTest: Game of Poker\nResult: Won every hand until last, at which point subject \"went all in\" (wagered all winnings) and lost game.\nNote: Okay, we've established he's good at games. That's not why we're interested in him. We need to go bigger. \u2014 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nTest Log 503-4\nTest: Firearm aimed at head, point-blank range.\nResult: Sixty (60) consecutive misfires with 17 different weapons. Later laboratory testing determined that the weapons failed due to, variously, jams caused by debris, malfunctioning parts, or total mechanical failure. Of particular note is the final weapon used, a revolver (a type of weapon renowned for its reliability), which jammed due to a slight mechanical defect that could only be replicated after 254 test shots in the laboratory, and since then has yet to be replicated a second time, despite \u2588\u2588\u2588 additional test firings. During Test 503-4, the revolver failed to fire eight (8) consecutive times.\nTest Log 503-5\nTest: \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d with 1 empty chamber, aimed at subject\u2019s chest\nResult: Severe trauma to chest, bullet passes through center of heart, piercing no chambers. Rib broken. Subject survives.\nNote: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been disciplined and reassigned. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588 will carry out further testing. \u2014 O5-\u2588.\nSee Test Report 503-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 for additional tests.\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-503\" by DStecks, from the SCP Wiki.
