  "content": "Item #: SCP-839\nObject Class: Safe\nSpecial Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-839 are to be kept in containment chamber 839-1. The chamber is to be supplied with approximately half (1/2) of a kilogram of various plant matter daily. Mating of SCP-839 is to be regulated, and any extra instances of SCP-839 are to be kept in Foundation medical centers for treatment of ill individuals.\nDescription: SCP-839 appears to be a species of annelid composed of sugar, flavouring and colouring. A microscopic label stating \"CANDIED WORM\" is found near each instance's posterior, followed by a smaller label stating the instance's \"flavour\". Each \"flavour\" is currently designated as SCP-839-x.\nSCP-839 is generally found in temperate areas. SCP-839's diet mainly consists of decomposing organic matter, however when there is no decaying matter apparent SCP-839 may ingest live plant matter. SCP-839 sexually reproduces. Mating [REDACTED], followed by the egg hatching into a newborn instance of SCP-839.\nWhen SCP-839 is ingested by any mammal, it will burrow through the stomach lining and towards a specialized organ. The choice of organ appears to be dependent on SCP-839's \"flavour\". SCP-839 will then attach itself to the organ and slowly ingest it. While the organ disappears, SCP-839 will change in form and chemical composition in order to match the organ. SCP-839 does not act as a perfect replacement, and other effects may occur. This process may take \u2588 to \u2588\u2588 days to complete.1\nSCP-839 has an average lifespan of three years. Users of SCP-839 are recommended to replace their integrated instance with a new instance every two years.\nAddendum 839-1: Current \"flavours\" of SCP-839\n\n\n\"Flavour\"\nColouration\nOrgan Replaced\nOther Effects\nDesignation\n\n\nCherry\nRed\nHeart\nIncreased blood sugar, Type-2 Diabetes\nSCP-839-1\n\n\nBlue Raspberry\nBlue\nKidney (One)\nBlue urine\nSCP-839-2\n\n\nGreen Apple\nGreen\nEye (One)\nMild hallucinations, \"greenish\" tint\nSCP-839-3\n\n\nWatermelon\nPink\nBrain\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\nSCP-839-4\n\n\nLemon\nYellow\nStomach\nLess Fibre content, diarrhea (Note: recommended for use with other instances of SCP-839, due to the ulcers created)\nSCP-839-5\n\n\nGrape\nPurple\nLung (one)\n\"Fruity\" smell to breath\nSCP-839-6\n\n\nOrange\nOrange\nLiver\nIncreased acidity of bloodstream (Not recommended)\nSCP-839-7\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1. Similarities between the life cycles of SCP-839 and SCP-1517 has been noted. Investigation into the possibility of a shared origin is under investigation.\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-839\" by Salman Corbette, from the SCP Wiki.
