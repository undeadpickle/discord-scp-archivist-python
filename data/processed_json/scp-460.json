  "content": "Item #: SCP-460\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-460 is to be tracked and observed by Mobile Task Force Mu-13, while containing any serious incidents as they occur. All relevant information is to be transmitted, encrypted, and backed up at Site 19. During any major ectoplasmic event, all personnel are to evacuate a minimum of 5 miles from SCP-460\u2019s current location.\nDescription: SCP-460 is a free-floating mass of cumulonimbus, with an average diameter of 3.5\u00a0km. Normally, SCP-460 takes the form of a large ring, and is unaffected by standard meteorological conditions that a cloud of its shape and size would be. The composition of the cloud itself is typical, with frozen water (H2O) making up 98.7%. However, the remaining 1.3% of the cloud consists of a highly active form of ectoplasm, which lends to SCP-460\u2019s unique properties.\nTypically, SCP-460 is dormant, floating at a speed generally relative to the current wind speed of the surrounding area. Occasionally, SCP-460 will halt its movement, usually over an area of moderate population. Once completely stationary, the ectoplasm of SCP-460 will condense and fall as a viscous rain, causing the spirits of the recently dead to manifest in a physical form as ghosts. This rain occurs as a light shower after the main downpour, with only intermittent pauses. Normally, only subjects who have died within the last year will manifest, with only the rare exception. Of note is that not only humans are capable of returning as a ghost, but also all sentient life that possesses a purpose for their manifestation.\nSpirits that manifest in this have complete autonomy while SCP-460 remains stationary, and will revert back to whatever nature they possessed in life. The actual manifestation, however, varies on a case-by-case basis. Most subjects who return from a non-violent death are often passive and appear much like they did in life. Variations occur mostly among the spirits of those who suffered a violent end, with many victims of crimes such as murder and rape manifesting as ghostly avatars of justice. It should be noted that deaths caused as a result of SCP-460 would result in further manifestation.\nOver time, the ectoplasm making up individual manifestations will \u201cevaporate\u201d and rise back up to the main body of SCP-460. This may take anywhere from several days to a few weeks, depending on the temperature and general humidity of the area. Once SCP-460 starts moving again, any remaining manifestations are instantaneously vaporized, and the cycle starts over. After becoming mobile, SCP-460 will wander for an indeterminable amount of time, with no pattern or common habits.\nDiscovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 near Siberia, where reports of a literal \u201cghost town\u201d had begun to circulate into the press at large. The number of ectoplasmic manifestations caused by the long-term stay of SCP-460 was overwhelming, and due to the violent nature of the now discontented spirits, a large military operation was required to secure the area. The surviving personnel now make up what is now Mobile Task Force Mu-13 aka \u201cGhostbusters\u201d. SCP-460 was immediately classified as a Keter class SCP, with all research diverted into predicting its movements to avoid further incidents.\nAddendum: Due to the outcome (or lack thereof) of Incident 460-b and 460-c, item has been reclassified as Euclid.\n\nObservation Log 460-a\nAll relevant reports from Mu-13 are to be catalogued and formatted as follows:\nSubject: Amy Glaskow, formerly a housemaker and mother of 3.\nDate: \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nDOD: \u2588-\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nLocation: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Liverpool\nCause of death: Auto accident.\nDescription: Comparison to pre-death records showed little difference in appearance due to manifestation.
