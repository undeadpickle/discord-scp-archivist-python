  "content": "Item #: SCP-363\nObject Class: Keter\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-363 specimens are contained in a 2\u00a0m x 2\u00a0m x 2\u00a0m room that is to be constantly illuminated by high-powered lighting. This lighting must be connected to multiple redundant power sources, and in case of total system failure, Mobile Task Force Eta-Seven is to be dispatched to assess the threat.\nSCP-363 is to be fed twenty (20) lab mice, administered once every forty-eight (48) hours.\nDescription: Ostensibly, SCP-363 are identical to Scolopendra gigantea, or the Amazonian giant centipede. Dietary needs are identical, and DNA inspection has proven no dissimilarities to normal S. gigantea.\nSCP-363 is, under normal circumstances, the appropriate size for S. gigantea. In darkness, (darkness defined here as any level of light under 2 lux) which it actively seeks out, however, SCP-363 will grow rapidly and erratically, to sizes up to and exceeding 10\u00a0m x 2\u00a0m. SCP-363 does not retain the form of a centipede under these conditions. So far, reports have documented: proboscises, tentacles, highly elongated mandibles, an inconsistent number of eyes and legs, and, in one case, [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-363 will revert back to normal size and appearance after 2-3 hours of illumination of a level of at least 50 lux.\nSCP-363 will attack any animal emitting body heat, and appears to be able to detect and hunt in total darkness. It is assumed it uses other senses to hunt, with vision in a secondary position.\nReproductive cycle of SCP-363 is similar to that of normal S. gigantea, with one difference. Rather than in a cluster of leaves and dirt, eggs are laid and fertilized in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cavity of paralyzed [DATA EXPUNGED], followed by death.\nAddendum 1: Note from Dr. Skalder: We've determined that fire seems to scare or ward off SCP-363. In light of this, we have equipped three of the members of MTF Eta-Seven, \"Creepy Crawlies\", with military-issue M2A1-7 flamethrowers.\nAddendum 2: Incident report of breach.\n\nDocument# 363-Alpha: Breach 1\nPersonnel involved: MTF-Eta-7\nDate: 21-5-2003\nLocation: Site-\u2588\u2588\nDescription: Attempted retrieval of SCP-363 specimen during power failure/containment breach.\n<Start of audio log>\nMTF Eta-7 Commander Johnson: Perts, any word from Technical on (distortion) cameras?\nContactsman Perts: No dice, commander. Complete equipment failure throughout the sector.\nC. Johnson: Alright. Night-vision on, motion-sensors go. Fredmann, McShaugn, Aidelare, report to rendezvous point.\nLieutenant McShaugn: Copy that, commander. Sub-team Hornet coming in, over.\nC. Johnson: Sub-team Wasp, come in.\n(Radio silence)\nC. Johnson: Wasp, do you copy? Over.\nUnknown: (Shouting) Jesus Christ almighty, torch that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588- (signal cuts out)\nC. Johnson: Damn it. O'Denn? O'Denn, can you hear me? What is your position? Over.\nLieutenant O'Denn: Outside of Lab 8. We found it, sir. It's holed up in there. It got De Aunaign. Over.\nC. Johnson: Casualty?\nL. O'Denn: Mangled leg, sir. We scared the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in there with the flamethrower, don't think it's coming out. Are they fixing the power yet? Over.\nC. Johnson: Forget about that, O'Denn. Tell Von Hower to keep his flamer trained on the door. Hornet, can you hear me? Over.\nL. McShaugn: Loud and clear, sir.\nC. Johnson: Forget the rendezvous. Relocate to Lab 8, don't engage yet. Copy?\nL. McShaugn: Going (interrupted by loud noise) \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 my grandmother! What was that?! Aidelare, do you see anything?! Over!\nFlamer Aidelare: (Extensive swearing) There's another one of those \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in here! Second containment breach, commander!\nC. Johnson: Has it seen you? Over.\nF. Aidelare: I don't reckon, sir.\nC. Johnson: Good. Try to keep it that way. Perts, how many of those things did they keep in here?\nC.M Perts: (Relays question to contact.) Eight, sir.\nC. Johnson: Good God. Okay, tell 'em \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 the preservation and detonate the gas charges\".\nC.M Perts: They uh, they can't, sir.\nC. Johnson: Why the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 not, Perts?\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\nL. O'Denn: So we're all \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 three days from Sunday. Good to know. Orders, commander?\nC. Johnson: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 'em all and burn it down, O'Denn. Tell Von Hower and Aidelare to set fire to Lab 8, then split up and do a sweep of the area. Neutralize all hostile centipede \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\nL. O'Denn: Copy that.\nC. Johnson: Perts, still no contact with Blackfly?\nC.M Perts: Blackfly, report in.\n(Radio silence)\nC.M Perts: No Blackfly.\nC. Johnson: I gathered, Perts. Alright, O'Denn, status repo-\nUnknown: (Gasping, groaning)\nC. Johnson: The\u2026who's that? Identify.\nUnknown: Flamer Tell, sir.\nC. Johnson: What is your status, Tell? What of Blackfly? Over.\nF. Tell: \u2026dead. Everyone.\nC. Johnson: Repeat that, Tell?\nF. Tell: (screaming) We're all \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 dead down here, commander!

Please sit down. Thank you, now, you said you saw \u201csomething\u201d after the firebombing. Care to expand on that?\n\u2588\u2588\u2588: It was\u2026well, one of those guys from the MTF you had stationed there. Eta-7. One of those guys, yeah.\nI.: Do you know his name, perchance?\n\u2588\u2588\u2588: Yeah, yeah, I talked to him once. That guy, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Tell. One of the flamers.\nI.: Are you sure it was him?\n\u2588\u2588\u2588: (Short silence) No. No, I ain\u2019t sure. It\u2026it looked like him, for sure. But there were all these things\u2026growing out of him. Like insect legs, but, all in random places\u2026from his chest, his arms, and\u2026one of \u2018em was pokin\u2019 out of of his eyeball. His eye was just gone. And his mouth\u2026there were these, like, these pinchers. Mandibles. All black.
