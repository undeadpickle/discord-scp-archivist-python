  "content": "Item #: SCP-124\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-124 is to be kept in a 4.2\u00a0m x 2.1\u00a0m stone pit in its containment cell. The pit is to be 1.5 metres deep. A plastic tarp is to be placed over SCP-124 when not in use. Absolutely no biological matter is allowed within one metre of SCP-124 when not being studied. An armed guard is to be stationed outside SCP-124's cell at all times.\nDescription: SCP-124 is a plot of soil approximately 9\u00a0m2 in area and 14\u00a0m3 in size. It was recovered from a Detroit basement when authorities were notified of two teenagers growing large amounts of marijuana.\nSCP-124 has the ability to grow any biological organism to its full potential in a relatively short amount of time (the length varies according to the complexity of the organism). Nothing growing in SCP-124 requires external nutrients or other resources (for example, a tomato plant would not require water or light). Pesticides, too, aren't needed, as SCP-124 has a repellent effect on any insect or other invertebrates not growing in it. Any food grown in SCP-124 is reported to be of very high quality, taste, and nutrition, no matter what state the food was in before being planted in SCP-124.\nDocument 124-1: List of items grown in SCP-124\n\nThe following is a selective list of objects grown in SCP-124 during experiments.\nInput - Product of SCP-124\nTomato Seed - Fully grown tomato plant. All tomatoes (12 on each plant) were ripe and juicy. Reported to be \"very tasty\".\nSmall Watermelon (0.8\u00a0kg) - 11.1\u00a0kg (24.5\u00a0lb) watermelon. Reported to be \"very sweet and tasty\".\nGrass Seed (1) - SCP-124 quickly sprouted into a lush, green lawn within a matter of seconds. Slight dew on the grass.\nSmall, overgrown hedge - A hedge, trimmed and shaped like a dolphin.\nSmall, overgrown hedge - A hedge, trimmed and shaped like a skull.\nSmall Labrador Retriever puppy (sandy brown) - A fully grown, bronze-colored Labrador Retriever in peak condition.
