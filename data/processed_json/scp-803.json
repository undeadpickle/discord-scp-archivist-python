  "content": "Item #: SCP-803\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: All \u2588\u2588 instances of SCP-803 are to be contained in seperate biohazard containment cells at Site-\u2588\u2588. The specimens are to be fitted with radio transmitters set to secure channels. One D-class subject is to be provided for experimentation in the event of extreme hostility from SCP-803 instances.\nDescription: SCP-803-1 is a currently undetermined number of autonomous machines, resembling small umbrellas, averaging 170 centimetres in width and 150 centimetres in height. An average specimen is almost indistinguishable from a normal umbrella. There are no identifying marks or labels on instances of SCP-803-1. When unfolded, a large amount of medical equipment is visible on the underside of SCP-803-1's canopy. These include vials of varying liquids and gases, plastic tubing, syringes, scalpels, various motors and joints, [DATA EXPUNGED]. All specimens possess the ability to retract, disguise or otherwise hide this equipment, making identification of SCP-803-1 in the field difficult. All attempts to disassemble or deactivate instances of SCP-803 are forbidden by order of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (see addendum 803-01).\nSCP-803-2 resemble SCP-803-1 in almost all respects, except for a greatly increased wingspan of 5 metres and a central power system apparently fueled by [REDACTED]. SCP-803-2 serve as carriers for swarms of SCP-803-1 on rows of metal hooks that replace the medical equipment found in instances of SCP-803-1.\nThe primary function of SCP-803 instances appears to be the capture, experimentation, and occasionally dissection vivisection of medium to large mammals using the aforesaid apparatus. Specimens of SCP-803-2 hunt by either waiting in a large, open area or by tumbling through the air using natural updrafts and bursts of compressed air emitted from the tips of their canopy. Upon encountering a viable target, the instance will release its flock of SCP-803-1, who will proceed to inject a muscle relaxant into the subject and then experiment upon it. \u2588\u2588% of subjects survive these procedures, which may involve removal and/or transplantation of organs, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid sampling, monitoring of [DATA EXPUNGED], and may last up to \u2588\u2588\u2588 minutes. Surviving subjects report being fully conscious during the experiments, as well as intense pain and feelings of panic.\nFlocks of SCP-803 comprise an average of \u2588\u2588 (\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588) individuals, and have been sighted in the following locations:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Brazil.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Japan.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Australia.\n[DATA EXPUNGED].\nAddendum 803-01: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, several D-class subjects were ordered by Research Assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to dismantle an instance of SCP-803-1 using hammers, saws and wrenches. When the first D-class attempted to remove the handle, the specimen violently ruptured. Two of the three D-class were injured by large, sharp pieces of metal from the instance, inflicting wounds comparable to those caused by crossbow bolts fired at close range. One D-class died instantly due to a metal rod entering his skull. The second D-class initially survived, but later died of viral infections carried on the needles of the specimen. The third D-class quickly [REDACTED] due to unidentified chemicals within SCP-803-1, with only 1.2 kilos of biological material being recovered. Research Assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was severely reprimanded.\nAddendum 803-02: On \u2588\u2588/\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, autopsy of a D-class subject captured by SCP-803-1 instances during the [REDACTED] containment breach discovered a small metallic dodecahedron at the top of the spinal column. The purpose of this object is currently unknown.\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-803\" by Cryokina, from the SCP Wiki.
