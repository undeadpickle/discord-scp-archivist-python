  "content": "Item #: SCP-137\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-137 is to be kept in a locked room, with a hairbrush and posters depicting a country meadow to keep it placid and tractable. SCP-137 is to be fed three meals a day. Under no circumstances are any toys allowed to come within five hundred (500) meters of SCP-137.\nDescription: SCP-137 is an entity with the ability to possess a toy, gaining the physical properties, size, and shape of whatever it represents; for example, a teddy bear will become an actual bear, and behave accordingly. SCP-137 cannot possess any miscellaneous object, only toys. The observed range of SCP-137's possessive effect is two hundred fifty (250) meters, but until further testing has been accomplished, SCP-137 is assumed to have a maximum range of five hundred (500) meters from its position.\nSCP-137 was first brought to Foundation attention after a series of bizarre deaths and incidents involving children. The deaths were determined to be too random to be a serial killer, and Foundation agents were sent in to investigate. It was located after an interview with a young girl suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, after a naked man had appeared in her bedroom. It was encountered in the same neighborhood in the form of a gorilla. SCP-137 was then tracked and finally captured when it possessed a stuffed pony doll in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and was chased into the nearby wilderness. SCP-137 was tranquilized, and extracted to Site-19 by helicopter.\nTesting has shown that SCP-137 takes on the characteristics of the toy it possesses, but only as a child might perceive it. A toy soldier becomes a violent, well-armed man. A toy gun fires bullets. A toy lion attacks and kills humans. However, it lacks true intelligence. It shows no sign of long-term memory, nor any capacity for learning or abstract thinking (See Interview 137-1). For more information, please refer to Experiment Log 137.\nIt is currently inhabiting a princess doll, of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 line.\nAddendum\nInterview 137-1:\nInterviewed: SCP-137\nInterviewer: Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nForeword: Interview took place to determine what SCP-137 is, and why and how it possesses toys.\n<Begin Log>\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Good day.\nSCP-137: Hello! I'm Princess Blossom. Are you my prince?\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: No. Now, can you please tell me what you are?\nSCP-137: I am a princess! I am the prettiest princess in the whole world!\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Where did you come from?\nSCP-137: I live in a castle. Are you my prince?\n*Further questioning yielded similar results.*\n<End Log>\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-137\" by DrEverettMann and Arlecchino, from the SCP Wiki.
