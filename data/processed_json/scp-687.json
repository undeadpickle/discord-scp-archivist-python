  "content": "Item #: SCP-687\nObject Class: Safe\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-687 is to be kept in a secured room at Site-15. The room is to contain a desk with locking drawers, a standard office chair, and a 12\u201d analog color television as well as equipment to record and remotely monitor testing of SCP-687.\nWhen not being actively tested, SCP-687-1 is to be powered down and disconnected from its power source, and SCP-687-3 is to be kept in an anti-static envelope and locked in the top drawer of the desk supporting SCP-687-1 & SCP-687-2. SCP-687-2 should remain attached to SCP-687-1 to prevent wear on the connecting hardware.\nWhen being tested, SCP-687-1 and SCP-687-2 are to be plugged into one standard \u2588\u2588\u2588 UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) that is connected to the facility power grid. UPS is to be replaced after each 100 hours of use.\nUnder no circumstances are Class D personnel to be used for testing SCP-687 (ref: Incident I-687-1). Testing is permitted by personnel with clearance 3 or above with written approval by the site director.\nDescription: SCP-687-1 is a Commodore 64 home computer built in 198\u2588, serial number S000\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Non-invasive examination of the hardware confirms that it has not been obviously modified and all parts appear to be from the original manufacturer.\nSCP-687-2 is a Commodore 1541\u00a05.25\u201d Disk Drive built the same year as SCP-687-1, serial number S000\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. As with SCP-687-1, all parts appear original and not obviously modified. If an attempt is made to turn on SCP-687-2 when it is disconnected, or connected to any computer other than SCP-687-1, it will fail to operate. When SCP-687-2 is connected to SCP-687-1, both units perform to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications (except when loading SCP-687-3 as specified below).\nSCP-687-3 is a 5.25\u201d floppy disk without manufacturer\u2019s markings. Affixed to the disk is a hand-written label with the word \u201cDOCUMENTS\u201d in block capitals. Attempts to read the disk with any drive other than SCP-687-2 results in severe read errors and potential damage to the hardware. Passive scans using [REDACTED] inconclusive and produce conflicting data.\nWhen SCP-687-2 is connected to SCP-687-1, SCP-687-3 can be loaded into the drive and read like any normal disk. Only one file, \u201cNOIR\u201d is visible to the operating system. This file can be executed by typing LOAD \u201cNOIR\u201d,8,1.\nWhen loading and running the \u201cNOIR\u201d program, the heat output of both SCP-687-1 and SCP-687-2 increases by 400%, and power consumption will double. Any testing equipment attached to ports on the computer or drive will experience severe and random voltage spiking. These anomalies do not appear to impact performance or cause any damage to SCP-687-1 or SCP-687-2.\nOnce the \u201cNOIR\u201d program is loaded, the user is presented with a short graphic stating \u201cCracked by the Timelordz.\u201d After approximately one minute, a title screen appears. The title screen reads \u201cNOIR: a hardboiled adventure by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Games. Copyright 198\u2588.\u201d There is no record of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Games releasing a game with this title. Pressing the space bar will launch the game.\n\u201cNOIR\u201d appears to be a text-based adventure game similar to many other games released about the same time. However, the parser appears able to comprehend any intelligible English command, even with some words misspelled. In addition, there seems to be no functional limit to the game\u2019s territory, and it will respond to queries about its environment in detail beyond what should be possible given the data-storage limitations of the hardware running the game. The setting of the game will also change, based on who is playing. A new player will be placed in a new random environment; a returning player will be placed at whatever point that player ceased playing last. All initial environments so far presented by the game have been within urban areas within the United States between the years 1923 and 1942.\nBy using commands LOOK AT SELF and INVENTORY, it has been confirmed that a player\u2019s in-game avatar matches the appearance and dress the player had when starting the game. The player\u2019s in-game avatar will also possess whatever objects or equipment the player had on their person when starting the game.\nThe game is free-form and gives no obvious clues about how to win. However, it does keep a score that prints after every action. The score can go up or down with no indication of an upper or lower bound. High and low scores to date are \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and -\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. If a player dies in-game, the score is set at 0, and any future command typed in by that player during any future game session will receive the response, \u201cYou cannot do that. You are dead.\u201d\nNo abnormal effects are detectable on a player during gameplay. However, after a game session, the next time the player enters a REM sleep state they will have an unnaturally vivid dream where they experience the events that occurred during the game. During the dream, the player\u2019s perceptions are indistinguishable from reality. Extreme cases will show physical manifestations of injuries suffered within the dream. Examples include one subject who presented with bleeding of the fingernails after dreaming of unsuccessful attempts to escape the trunk of a car driven into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 River, another subject who developed severe bruising of the face and strain of the anterior longitudinal ligament after dreaming of being beaten by a hostile police officer, and another subject who presented with partial paralysis after dreaming being a victim of a 1929 gangland execution in a Chicago garage.\nTypically, such injuries are transient even in cases where the dreams end in fatality. However, severe psychological after-effects are likely, and will tend to be more severe than if the dreamed trauma had actually happened during a waking state. This is in large part due to the lack of volition subjects experience in the dream, and the foreknowledge of what is about to happen to them. All subjects report a complete belief in the reality of the dream world, even knowing they are replaying events from the game. If a subject has died violently in the game, the subsequent dream of the event can be traumatic enough that this belief can foster a delusion that the real world is unreal. Victims of this delusion report being convinced that they are still dreaming, or are in purgatory. Both physiological and psychological reactions are not clinically abnormal for the stresses subjects report experiencing within these dreams.\nGiven the experimental evidence of in-game actions having actual historical impact (ref: Experiment Log 687-A) it is theorized that the dreaming state is a side effect caused by the player\u2019s perceptions of game-directed activity catching up to the present day.\nAddendum 1: Experiment Log for SCP-687\n\n+\u00a0Experiment\u00a0Log\u00a0687-A\n\n-\u00a0Experiment\u00a0Log\u00a0687-A\n\n\nExperiment Log 687-A\nTest 005\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\nSubject: D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProcedure: Subject is provided an unloaded .45 automatic handgun, then is told to play the game and issue the command INVENTORY, followed by the command DROP GUN.\nResults: Subject\u2019s game avatar has an unloaded .45 automatic handgun in inventory of same make and model provided to subject. The command DROP GUN results in the gun being left in a dumpster next to subject\u2019s avatar. At this point the subject is ordered to exit the game. Physical gun is still in subject\u2019s possession and surrendered back to Foundation personnel.\nTest 006\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\nSubject: D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProcedure: Immediately after Test 005 Subject is provided a box of .45 caliber ammunition, then is told to resume the game.\nResults: Subject\u2019s game avatar appears in same place gameplay stopped during prior test. Subject types PICK UP GUN followed by the INVENTORY command. The subject\u2019s avatar now has both gun and ammunition in inventory. Subject\u2019s score increases by 10 points after gun is loaded. Physical gun is still in possession of Foundation personnel.\nTest 007\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\nSubject: D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProcedure: Subject with in-game possession of a loaded firearm is instructed to type command SHOOT SELF.\nResults: Subject\u2019s game avatar shoots itself. Score is reset to 0. All commands entered after this receive the response, \u201cYou cannot do that. You are dead.\u201d Subject expresses disappointment but suffers no immediate effect. The following morning, subject evidences considerable distress, showing uncontrolled tremors and weeping. When asked about cause of distress, subject responds, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop myself.\u201d\nTest 015\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\nSubject: D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProcedure: Subject with a game avatar occupying the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, in 1938 is instructed to place a classified ad in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Gazette reading \u201cDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a loser.\u201d\nResults: Subject types in command PLACE AD IN \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 GAZETTE THAT READS \"DR. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 IS A LOSER.\" The game parses command and prints five pages of narrative in response covering approximately three hours of game time including a bus ride to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Gazette offices, small talk with the receptionist, and a discussion with an editor about the content of the ad. Foundation researchers uncover microfiche records of the 12/01/1938 issue of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Gazette containing the ad \u201cDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is a loser.\u201d Score increases by 100 points.\nGiven the importance of these results, I will overlook the fact that I am not amused\u2014 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nTest 023\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588\nSubject: D-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProcedure: Subject with a game avatar occupying the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, in 1924 is given a first edition hardcover of Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut inscribed by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Once subject is playing game, subject is instructed to go to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 bank and place in-game copy of the book in a safety-deposit box.\nResults: Subject attempts to comply, but is caught in the crossfire of a gang war. Game avatar dies and score reset to 0.\nNote \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588: A routine audit of Foundation archives uncovered SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, an anomalous hardcover edition of Slaughterhouse Five recovered from a used bookstore in Los Angeles, CA, in 1947. The book bears inscription by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the additional phrase \u201cMiss me yet?\u201d written in human blood. Second inscription is consistent with the handwriting of D-67895.

Sociopath. Convicted of the [REDACTED] series of killings in [REDACTED]. Agents A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and C. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and Research Assistant Dr. G. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\nDate: \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nLocation: Containment room of SCP-687\nDescription: For a period of two weeks, D-67895, had been extremely cooperative with Foundation personnel and had logged 25 hours of gameplay covering approximately two months of in-game time during January and February 1934 in Cleveland, OH. D-67895 proves highly intelligent and adaptable, using the sophistication of the game\u2019s parser to complete very complex tasks with one or two commands. Permission granted to allow D-67895 to read newspapers of the era, as well as retain paper and writing implements to take notes.\nThree days before scheduled monthly termination, D-67895 is brought in for a routine scheduled session with SCP-687. Halfway into the session, D-67895 types the following unauthorized command: DO EVERYTHING WRITTEN ON PAGE ONE. Upon entering the command, approximately 150 pages of narrative text are printed on-screen. Dr. G. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, observing remotely, orders immediate end to the session, and initiates containment breach protocols. Agents A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and C. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, in the room with D-67895, attempt to restrain the subject and remove him from contact with SCP-687. D-67895 laughs, saying, \u201cToo late, boys.\u201d When the narrative text completes printing [DATA EXPUNGED].\nAside from SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-EX, no trace of Agent A. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Agent C. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or D-67895 has been recovered by the Foundation to date.\nGood Lord, did no one even think to look at the history of Cleveland in the mid-30s and compare it to D-67895\u2019s record? Could someone please Google \u201cTorso\u201d? \u2013 Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nThis might be worse than that. If SCP-687 does re-write history, it\u2019s quite possible that the \u201cTorso\u201d murders, or [REDACTED] for that matter, might not have even existed before this security breach. Do we have any way to know? From this point forward, no Class Ds are allowed near this thing.\u2013 O5-\u2588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\n\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation\n\nCite this page as:\n \n\n\"SCP-687\" by sandrewswann, from the SCP Wiki.
