SCP-829-B is not to be removed from its biohazard container so as to prevent any advanced polymer formation. Standard anti-contaminant quarantine procedures will apply to SCP-829-A and SCP-829-B's containment hangar. Only Level 3+ Personnel are allowed to access SCP-829-A and B.\nFoundation webcrawlers are to monitor and replace any references to twenty-one Concordes having been created with the disseminated cover that only twenty were produced; the twenty-first (217/F-BVFG) will assume the identification and livery of SCP-829-A. All individuals involved with British Airways Flight 3075 are to be amnesticized of SCP-829 and the passengers of the flight.\n\nDescription:\nSCP-829 is the designation for a temporal event that occurred during British Airways Flight 30751 on March 2nd, 1993. Details surrounding the SCP-829 event can be found in the Item History below.\nSCP-829-A is a FA/BAC Concorde supersonic airliner (210/G-BOAD) that was the subject of SCP-829. It appears to be non-anomalous, but is considered to be anomalous by proxy in order to study SCP-829.\nSCP-829-B is a viscous non-Newtonian fluid with a composition of water, amino acids, and other organic compounds. The method of 829-B's creation through polymer and DNA reduction is currently unknown.\n\nItem History:\nSCP-829 occurred at 1:21 PM GMT, seventeen minutes after takeoff. Immediately before the event, Speedbird 30752 notified Heathrow Air Traffic Control (H-ATC) that they would be flying on IFR due to low-to-no visibility; conflicting with weather reports that had come in greatly favoring VMC over IMC. H-ATC attempted to ascertain the state of Speedbird 3075, but all communication requests were unresponsive. Only the phrase \"Control, how do you hear me?\" was transmitted from Speedbird 3075 to H-ATC before the plane disappeared off of radar.\nSpeedbird 3075 (now SCP-829-A) re-appeared on radar at 11:53 AM EST. JFK Intl. Air Traffic Control (J-ATC) informed 829-A of radar contact and to go around3, but SCP-829-A did not respond and performed a landing on Runway 31L. J-ATC issued a temporary shutdown of Runway 31L following 829-A's non-compliance with further taxiing off of the runway. After visually identifying SCP-829-A from information forwarded by Heathrow, JFK Intl. contacted the Foundation under Rule 4, Subsection B of airport incident policy. Preliminary testing of SCP-829-A revealed that it was highly irradiated; after two days of hourly decontamination service, 829-A was deemed safe enough for MTF \u0394-9 (\"Baggage Claim\") to be inserted with full protection gear.\nAny subsequent pertinent information will be appended as addenda once fully reviewed.\n\nAddendum 01: INITIAL EXPLORATION\n\n\n\n\u00ab\u00a0Initial\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\u00a0Initial\u00a0Exploration\u00a0Log\u00a0\u00ab\n\n\n\nMTF OPERATION LOG\n\n\n\nThe following log was compiled during initial exploration of SCP-829-A by MTF \u0394-9 (\"Baggage Claim\"). Due to the ionizing radiation, Foundation body cameras were inoperable; personnel were instructed to verbally describe the interior of SCP-829-A.\nPersonnel assigned to MTF \u0394-9 at the time of the log's recording:\n\nResearcher Pierre Miller\nResearcher Aurey Standish\nResearcher Neil Haldane\n\n\n\n\n\n[MILLER]\nComms control, this is Miller. How do you read me?\n\n\n[COMCON]\nLoud and clear. You may proceed with the insertion process.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nWe're on the tarmac, approaching the instance currently. Haldane, you'll be right behind with the equipment, correct?\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nStandish and I have got the canisters.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nGood.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nDelta-Nine, we see you taking the stair unit up. We will not be able to keep visual contact once you are inside the craft, do you understand?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nWe understand, comms control.\n\n\n\nThere is a lengthy pause as Researcher Miller operates the door to SCP-829-A. The three researchers enter the airplane.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nIt's dark as hell in here.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nCould you be more specific, Standish?\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nYes, when there's a lack of light in an area, it pr-\n\n\n[MILLER]\nKnock it off.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nSorry.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nHe's correct though. There's poor visuals in here. We'll be using the auxiliary flashlights; turning them on now.\n\n\n\nThe click of the flashlight activation can be heard.\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nJesus\u2026\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nWhat the?\n\n\n\nIt is assumed at this time that the researchers make their way through the plane.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nDelta-Nine, what's going on? Are you alright?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nWe're- we're fine.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nUh, control, how many passengers were on the flight?\n\n\n[COMCON]\nOne-hundred and two.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nWell. Shit.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nComms control, we can only account for maybe a third of those passengers.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nPlease advise?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMost of the passengers we can see are still seated. They\u2026 appear to be sleeping, almost as if they're in a coma. No external injuries noted.\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nUnresponsive too. I attempted to wake one, even shined my flashlight in her eyes. Her pupils remained dilated.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nUnderstood. It's been logged. Anything else of note, Delta-Nine?\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nWho wants to tell them?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nI can.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nComms control, the interior of the plane is coated in this thick, sludge-like substance.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nIt's very sticky \u2014 makes it hard to maneuver.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nIt's of an orange-greenish color, but we don't know if the flashlight is affecting its visual appearance or not. Can we get a bio-collection team after we're finished to properly analyze the substance?\n\n\n[COMCON]\nThey've been queued up, Delta-Nine. Please use your canisters to collect some of the material if possible.\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nOn it.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nThe substance is all throughout the plane, but appears to be\u2026 collected in locations where the passengers have been. It's, well, hrm \u2014\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nHey, stay sharp. I think we've got a live one!\n\n\n[MILLER]\nComms did you hear?\n\n\n[COMCON]\nWe heard.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nWho was sitting in\u2026 seat 43B?\n\n\n[COMCON]\nGive us a second, Standish.\n\n\n\nA voice is heard off of A. Standish's external mic.\n\n\n[PASSENGER]\nWhere- where am I? Where are- hello? Hello?\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nJesus, he's thrashing around like crazy.\n\n\n[COMCON]\n43B was sold to one William Oparin.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMr. Oparin? Can you hear us?\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nYou forgot the speaker, Miller.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nCrap. You're right.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMr. Oparin? Can you hear us?\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nWho's there? Who are you? Where am I?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMr. Oparin, please calm down. I'm Pierre Miller, I'm with the British Airways medical team.\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nI- I can't see- you. It's bright\u2026 so bright\u2026 where am I?\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nDoesn't seem as worked up anymore.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMr. Oparin, you're still onboard your flight.\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nIt's been so long. It called out to me, singing. I was due. The spark.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nWho? Can you tell me what you're seeing, Mr. Oparin?\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nIt's bright. The sunlight brings forth a new term. I- I've been waiting so long. The sea\u2026 of us\u2026\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nHe's not here.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nI think we should move him. Get him to one of our docs.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nYou may be right, Standish. Comms control, can we-\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nOparin starts screaming loudly.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nUrgh!\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMr. Oparin, please, I need you to calm down. Mr. Oparin?\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nI'm going to move him.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nMr. Oparin!\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nIt burns\u2026 the heat, the sky is red\u2026 the light\u2026 it's bright, oh, so bright, it's bright.\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nI'm- I'm stuck!\n\n\n[MILLER]\nHaldane?\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nMiller, Standish, help! I'm fucking stuck, my hands are fucking glued to him.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nI can't separate them. Miller?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nI'm pulling!\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nMy children. My progenitors. They were unwilling to accept their fated days\u2026\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nPull harder for fuck's sake! God, man, c'mon!\n\n\n[MILLER]\nIt's not working. Standish, get the chemical remover, quick.\n\n\n[OPARIN]\nI don't! No. No. No! Help, someone help! I'm being pulled apaaaAAAAAAAAA\u2014\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nI've got it!\n\n\n[HALDANE]\nHe's liquefying! Goddammit, Standish, hurry up, he's liqu-\n\n\n\nThe feed from N. Haldane's mic cuts out.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nHaldane?\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nHaldane! Haldane?!\n\n\n\nThere is a pause.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nComms control, uh.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nHaldane's gone.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nRepeat that?\n\n\n[MILLER]\nHaldane is gone. Him and Oparin turned into the\u2026 substance.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nI'm sorry, Neil.\n\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n[COMCON]\nDelta-Nine. Get out of there as soon as possible. We're monitoring things and the Caulli levels in there are starting to spike.\n\n\n[STANDISH]\nCollected some of the material. Let's go.\n\n\n[MILLER]\nYeah. Let's\u2026 yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN. Haldane's mic re-activates.\n\n\n[???]\nI remain. I remain. Life..?\n\n\n[???]\nStandish\u2026 Miller\u2026. Standish\u2026 Miller\u2026 Standish\u2026\n\n\n[???]\nWhere am I?\n\n\n\nN. Haldane's mic cuts out again, permanently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum 02: FURTHER ANALYSIS ON SCP-829-B\n\n\n\n\u00ab\u00a0Carbon-14\u00a0Dating\u00a0Test\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\u00bb\u00a0Carbon-14\u00a0Dating\u00a0Test\u00a0\u00ab\n\nSeveral radiocarbon dating tests of the SCP-829-B fluid taken directly from the Haldane and Oparin coalescence estimates it to be approximately 3.7 billion years old.\nContinued testing of the anomaly is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1.
