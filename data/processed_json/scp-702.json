  "content": "Item #: SCP-702\nObject Class: Euclid\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-702 is to be contained in a crate lined with mundane packing materials. The crate is to be kept in a standard security locker with armed guards at all times. If the crate is breached, under no circumstances are any personnel to touch the SCP without wearing a pair of standard insulated gloves and an insulated coat. The slated destruction of SCP-702 is indefinitely postponed due to the unknown effects on SCP-702-1 and possible containment breaches.\nDescription: SCP-702 is a simple red vase of unknown design. Human contact with the vase causes an entity (herein referred to as SCP-702-1) to emerge from the vase and initiate contact with the individual coming into contact with SCP-702. The method of detection seems to be thermal in nature, as SCP-702-1 emerges when contact is established through thin, heat-transmitting materials, but does not emerge when contact is established through an insulated material. SCP-702-1 is a sapient gas-based life form that communicates through coordinated vibration of the air around it. A sample has been impossible to gather due to SCP-702-1's tendency to react violently to anyone coming into physical contact with it. Upon emergence, SCP-702-1 greets the subject establishing contact with SCP-702, and attempts to persuade the subject to give it a gift. If the subject refuses, the entity [DATA EXPUNGED] and takes a single object or part from the remains. Some objects are rejected by SCP-702-1, claiming that it \"already has one\", and demands a new gift, returning the offered object. If SCP-702-1 accepts the offered gift, it returns an object of roughly equal value to the subject and disappears. See Experiments 702-001 through 702-004 for a transcript of successful transactions with SCP-702.\nAddendum:\nTranscript Log of Experiment 702-001:\n\nSubject D-5567 was issued a freshly sharpened #2 Ticonderoga pencil.\nSubject D-5567: So, I just touch it?\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That's right, D-5567. You have the object ready, correct?\nSubject D-5567: Yeah, 's just a damn pencil, don't really see what I'm gonna do with it, though.\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Don't worry about that, just touch the vase.\nSubject D-5567: Alright, alright.\n[a sound of rushing air is heard]\nSubject D-5567: What the HELL?\nSCP-702-1: Greetings, corporeal one! I presume you are here to deal?\nSubject D-5567: I, uh, ah, uh\u2026\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: The pencil, you idiot!\nSubject D-5567: Uh, yes, sir!

How delightful!\nSCP-702-1: Well, you are clearly the one who bothered me, speak up!\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Talk to it!\n[Subject D-1699 gibbers incoherently]\nSCP-702-1: You waste my time, fool.

You gotta tell me first, doc!\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Subject D-1010, I remind you that deviation from protocol will result in immediate termination by Foundation security staff.\nSubject D-1010: I\u2026 I\u2026 fine.\n[a sound of rushing air is heard]\nSCP-702-1: Your kind again!

Here is my response.\n[an intake of air is heard]\nSubject D-1010: A\u2026 wow, that's heavy.\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Proceed to debriefing, 1010.\n[long period of silence, recording clicks off and clicks on again]\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-702-1 issued a two point eight kilogram jar of an unidentified liquid. The jar appears to be made of glass. The liquid is clear, but I am not removing the lid to identify odors. The jar will be sent to the labs for chemical analysis.\n\nTranscript Log of Experiment 702-004:\n\nSubject D-8133 was issued a vial containing a sample from SCP-158.\nSubject D-8133: So I touch the vase with this in my hand and give it away if I can?\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: That is correct, D-8133.
