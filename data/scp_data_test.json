As a result, Foundation efforts are to focus on the following:</p>\n<p>- Recovery of remaining motile civilians to Foundation-organized safe communities;</p>\n<p>- Restoration of Foundation technological and communications infrastructure wherever possible;</p>\n<p>- Restoration of the concept of \"time\" via reconstruction of SCP-001-1.</p>\n<p>Those affected by SCP-001 are currently considered lost. Preservation of the veil is to be disregarded.</p>\n<p>Foundation agents have the full approval of remaining O5 council members to eliminate persons or groups deemed hostile to the Foundation's mission with prejudice.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001 is categorized as a ZK-Class Temporal Cessation event, which resulted in the total cessation of the standard passage of time on February 13th, 2025 at 0710 PST. Following SCP-001, the natural progress of time as understood by society ceased. Affected persons, animals, inanimate objects, etc. remain locked in the position they were in when the event took place and are incapable of independent motion.</p>\n<p>While SCP-001 is believed to affect an overwhelming amount of the population, a currently unknown number of humans have remained unaffected. Unaffected individuals retain the ability to move and interact with their environment, however, most natural biological processes have ceased.</p>\n<p>The mechanics of SCP-001 are poorly understood beyond what is outlined above. Research remains ongoing.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-1 was a stone shrine dedicated to Aeternum<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> located within Olympic National Park in Washington, USA. This sanctum was the last remaining shrine to Aeternum, as well as the last location of modern worship of the deity. It collapsed on February 13th, 2025, though the reason for this collapse is currently unknown.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>Addendum 001.1:</strong> Briefing</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Following SCP-001, Foundation communication systems failed globally, severely limiting the ability of unaffected personnel to contact other Foundation sites and verify the status of vital personnel. Two unaffected instances of <a href=\"/scp-6459\">SCP-6459</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> were recovered, allowing rudimentary communications to be established between Foundation sites using pen and paper methods. These communications revealed that approximately 4 Foundation sites globally retained any staff capable of operations. Only one of these sites contained equipment designed to address temporal anomalies, and has since been dedicated entirely to the storage of the highest priority Foundation research and documentation.</p>\n<p>Through these newly established communication efforts, it was discovered that only two members of the O5 council remained. Following a meeting of the remaining members, the decision was made to enact SCP-001 containment procedures as stated and begin research and work into reversing SCP-001.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><strong>Addendum 001.2:</strong> February 13th, 2025\u00a00710 hours</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>The following logs were recorded by Foundation Agent Jessie Kidd, shared with Command via <a href=\"/scp-6459\">SCP-6459</a>.

A myriad of snowflakes hang in the air, tousled by an unseen and unfelt wind. I run my hands over a leaf on a tree. It's stiff beneath my touch, unmoving. I tug at it slightly, but it refuses to separate from the branch. I frown.</em></p>\n<p><em>The scene is beautiful, a painting of a moment in time. But it's one that feels empty, incomplete.</em></p>\n<p><em>I lift my eyepatch, and press two fingers against the wound. It's an old wound, to those who still make some attempt at tracking \"hours\" and \"minutes\" it would be at least 30 years old by now, but as I pull my fingers away I can see blood left behind. It's still fresh, still open. I lower my eyepatch, and leave a simple sigil on a tree nearby. Touching it, I mutter a small incantation. The mark remains dead.</em></p>\n<p><em>It's a fool's hope, but one I hold onto. Especially now with something beating in my chest.</em></p>\n<p><em>I pull the heart out from under my jacket, and it continues to beat in my hand in defiance of the world around it. This is what we've been working for, what we've been striving for. I press it against the sigil, and in a beat the world around comes back to life.</em></p>\n<p><em>Instinctively, I pull my jacket more securely over myself as a chill in the air I haven't felt in god knows how long rushes over me. A breeze blows a snowflake onto my cheek, and I could almost cry. Instead I find myself doubling over as every nerve in my body reactivates.

I get it, I get it!</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Do you have any info that gives me an idea of where the shrine actually is?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Hmmm\u2026 yes! \u2026Kinda! I didn't have a ton of offline records specifically on Aeternum since I don't normally get to touch \"deific\" stuff, but I do have a basic backup of the main Foundation database up to level 3 clearance.

Another shout from Agent Saul tells me he's joined.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Left!</p>\n<p><em>My instincts take over. I swing left, and a sword collides with the tree beside me.

Eventually I find myself standing on the edge of a ravine.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz, ideas?</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Enough is enough, kid.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul walks from the undergrowth and points his sword at me.

Is that bat on your hip for show, then?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I don't want to hurt you.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I sure as hell want to hurt you.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Now, Kidd! Shove him back!</p>\n<p><em>I rush Agent Saul, tackling with my shoulder. The impact sends him rolling to the ground. He tries to rise back to his feet but stumbles back.

Finally I find my voice.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> <em>Why?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You <em>know</em> why, kid. There's real evil in the world, and there are people who just <em>pretend</em> they aren't evil until the conditions that keep them moral vanish. That's all those rogue groups are\u2014 people who claimed morality until they got real bored and decided to take it out on everyone else. I spent enough of my time with the Foundation watching as they ignored things like this in favor of restoring their idea of \"normalcy\". This is what I mean when I say you need to get real already. If someone is trying to kill you, fight back.</p>\n<p><em>He shoves me.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> The fact you're ignorant to all of this here says enough.

Hell you could've asked me when I was still Foundation what it was that I believed in, and I'd just give you a slack-jawed \"for humanity\" response. The Keepers have made something new from all of that, we've made a proper society. We actually make an effort to deal with the people who do things like this while the Foundation sits on its hands fixating on the past.

A woman ordering coffee from a stand, a businessman on his cellphone, a homeless man and his dog huddled together as the others simply walk by.</em></p>\n<p><em>Saul turns to me with a severe expression.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> There's something I need to know.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Ask away.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Before all this, you worked in amnestics, right? I never messed with the stuff myself, but there were always rumors of the Foundation using them to basically set everything back to zero. You know, mass memory wipe the world to act like something never happened. I never put much stock into stuff like that, it was always too far-fetched for me. But I gotta know\u2026 is it true?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Nope, nu-uh, nothing doing. That's classified info!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Yeah, it's true.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Heh, should've guessed as much. Guess we were always working for a pretty shady group, eh? Seems like I've been the bad guy for longer than I thought.</p>\n<p><em>I laugh. It's the first genuine laugh I've had in so long.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I guess so. Running away and avoiding the fight isn't always so bad, huh? When you run you're always a step ahead. Even if we didn't have that ability, though, things would be ok in the end. Humanity can always rebuild. We've done it before, time and time again.</p>\n<p><em>I smile.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> \u2026Things are bad now, but they'll get better. They have to.</p>\n<p><em>Saul stops walking, and turns to me.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Turn around, and run.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Huh? But I\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I said it before back when we first fell into the ravine. You're a wanted fugitive in our eyes, and the second you set foot near the base proper we're taking that heart and ensuring the Foundation has no hopes of getting it back. If you want any hope of your little mission succeeding, then now's your time to run, Kidd.</p>\n<p><em>I take a step back.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> That's it, then? No tricks?</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> None. I can't say I believe in your mission but\u2026 well I don't really know what I believe in right now. What I do know is that you really seem to believe in it, so go for it. Prove me wrong.</p>\n<p><em>I nod, and turn to run. Before I can, however, my escape is blocked off by a set of Keeper agents. I turn around to see Saul's way forward blocked as well.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> \u2026What's the meaning of this, exactly? Stand down!</p>\n<p><em>One of the agents, an apparent leader, shakes her head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Former Agent Saul and Foundation Agent Kidd, we order you to surrender your arms and stand down.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> What the hell? You don't get to bark orders at me, I outrank you!</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Unfortunately the decision was made to strip you of rank and title the second you betrayed the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> What are you talking about?!</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> By refusing to secure the relic when provided ample opportunity and giving a chance for a known fugitive to escape, you have violated the code of The Keepers that you agreed to on induction.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> This is insa\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I surrender.</p>\n<p><em>I put my arms behind my head and drop to me knees.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Agent Kidd?!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I surrender on the explicit condition that Agent Saul is pardoned for his actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Kidd you can't be serious!</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> \u2026Those terms are amicable. Gentlemen, cuff him.</p>\n<p><em>Two agents rush over. They kick me to the ground, handcuffing me. They take my bat and toss it aside.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Enough, let him go!</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> The orders regarding the capture and arrest of Agent Kidd are clear. As for you\u2026</p>\n<p><em>She kicks at his legs, taking him to the ground. She follows it up with a solid kick to the ribs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Treason is treason, Saul.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I've surrendered, leave him be!</p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> I don't believe that we actually <em>owe</em> you anything. There has to be order.</p>\n<p><em>She motions to the agent beside her, who draws his sword.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Agent:</strong> As for you, the penalty for treason where I'm from normally amounts to death. Since that's not much of an option, I can at least offer the next best thing.</p>\n<p><em>The agent next to her brings his sword. It falls down on Saul's left arm, cleaving it away from the shoulder. It falls to the ground. Saul's mouth hangs agape.</em></p>\n<p><em>I scream.</em></p>\n<p><em>My body acts before my mind can think. I struggle against the handcuffs as the man brings his sword down again against Saul's chest, sending him rolling against the pavement.</em></p>\n<p><em>I grab my prosthetic arm and rip it free, breaking from the handcuffs. The men attempt to restrain me. I begin beating them with the arm. It isn't my bat. It's nothing like my bat. The rage I feel in this moment is the first thing I've felt in so long. In this moment, it's enough.</em></p>\n<p><em>The other agents attempt to restrain me, but I weave between their blows. I strike behind their knees, and send them to the ground. I kick them aside.</em></p>\n<p><em>I race to Saul's side and help him back to his feet. He's stunned, mouth still agape.</em></p>\n<p><em>I drop my arm, and draw his sword.</em></p>\n<p><em>I swing without aim or care. The weapon is unfamiliar to me, heavy in my hand. I cut down the agent that started this, and I flee dragging Saul with me.</em></p>\n<p><em>And we run. It's the one thing I know: to run and get away.</em></p>\n<p><em>I offer a prayer as we escape.

The old gods slowly faded as the old stories and rituals that once sustained them stopped getting passed down and were relegated to little more than fairytales.</em></p>\n<p><em>Saul had expected something grand when we crested the hill, signs that some great power had once resided here.

Likely constructed from anomalous materials to begin with, which is probably why it even lasted as long as it did. You'll need to reconstruct the shrine itself first, then insert the heart as a keystone.

There's enough damage done and enough people who will remember this that it risks a total breach of normalcy. It's almost guaranteed that the Foundation is going to have a pretty aggressive amnestics campaign when it's all said and done.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> \u2026So even if we survive, we're just gonna forget it all, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> \u2026Yes.

All that remains is the keystone, ready to be placed into the chest of the humanoid figure that sat at the center of the shrine.</em></p>\n<p><em>I place my fingers in the wound on Saul's chest, and draw the sigil in the hole of the shrine.

Heat from the flames around us, the chill of a cool breeze.</em></p>\n<p><em>And every nerve ending in my body activating.

A moment, and actual</em> real <em>moment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> \u2026It's beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>Another breeze blows, carrying the chirp of a songbird with it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Good morning, Saul.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Good morning, Kidd.</p>\n<p><em>I cry.

As a result, Foundation efforts are to focus on the following:\n\n\n\n- Recovery of remaining motile civilians to Foundation-organized safe communities;\n\n\n\n- Restoration of Foundation technological and communications infrastructure wherever possible;\n\n\n\n- Restoration of the concept of \"time\" via reconstruction of SCP-001-1.\n\n\n\nThose affected by SCP-001 are currently considered lost. Preservation of the veil is to be disregarded.\n\n\n\nFoundation agents have the full approval of remaining O5 council members to eliminate persons or groups deemed hostile to the Foundation's mission with prejudice.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is categorized as a ZK-Class Temporal Cessation event, which resulted in the total cessation of the standard passage of time on February 13th, 2025 at 0710 PST. Following SCP-001, the natural progress of time as understood by society ceased. Affected persons, animals, inanimate objects, etc. remain locked in the position they were in when the event took place and are incapable of independent motion.\n\n\n\nWhile SCP-001 is believed to affect an overwhelming amount of the population, a currently unknown number of humans have remained unaffected. Unaffected individuals retain the ability to move and interact with their environment, however, most natural biological processes have ceased.\n\n\n\nThe mechanics of SCP-001 are poorly understood beyond what is outlined above. Research remains ongoing.\n\n\n\nSCP-001-1 was a stone shrine dedicated to Aeternum[[footnote]]A deific figure believed to oversee the natural flow of time.[[/footnote]] located within Olympic National Park in Washington, USA. This sanctum was the last remaining shrine to Aeternum, as well as the last location of modern worship of the deity. It collapsed on February 13th, 2025, though the reason for this collapse is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**Addendum 001.1:** Briefing[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nFollowing SCP-001, Foundation communication systems failed globally, severely limiting the ability of unaffected personnel to contact other Foundation sites and verify the status of vital personnel. Two unaffected instances of [[[SCP-6459]]][[footnote]]Anomalous homing pigeons with above average intelligence, awareness, and dexterity.[[/footnote]] were recovered, allowing rudimentary communications to be established between Foundation sites using pen and paper methods. These communications revealed that approximately 4 Foundation sites globally retained any staff capable of operations. Only one of these sites contained equipment designed to address temporal anomalies, and has since been dedicated entirely to the storage of the highest priority Foundation research and documentation.\n\n\n\nThrough these newly established communication efforts, it was discovered that only two members of the O5 council remained. Following a meeting of the remaining members, the decision was made to enact SCP-001 containment procedures as stated and begin research and work into reversing SCP-001.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**Addendum 001.2:** February 13th, 2025 0710 hours[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe following logs were recorded by Foundation Agent Jessie Kidd, shared with Command via [[[SCP-6459]]]. These logs have been stored in Temporal Exclusionary Site-37[[footnote]]A Foundation site designed to preserve important documents and records in the event of temporal anomalies and timeline shifts.[[/footnote]] for recordkeeping and posterity.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n//As I walk through this frozen forest, I stop to address the world around me. A myriad of snowflakes hang in the air, tousled by an unseen and unfelt wind. I run my hands over a leaf on a tree. It's stiff beneath my touch, unmoving. I tug at it slightly, but it refuses to separate from the branch. I frown.//\n\n\n\n//The scene is beautiful, a painting of a moment in time. But it's one that feels empty, incomplete.//\n\n\n\n//I lift my eyepatch, and press two fingers against the wound. It's an old wound, to those who still make some attempt at tracking \"hours\" and \"minutes\" it would be at least 30 years old by now, but as I pull my fingers away I can see blood left behind. It's still fresh, still open. I lower my eyepatch, and leave a simple sigil on a tree nearby. Touching it, I mutter a small incantation. The mark remains dead.//\n\n\n\n//It's a fool's hope, but one I hold onto. Especially now with something beating in my chest.//\n\n\n\n//I pull the heart out from under my jacket, and it continues to beat in my hand in defiance of the world around it. This is what we've been working for, what we've been striving for. I press it against the sigil, and in a beat the world around comes back to life.//\n\n\n\n//Instinctively, I pull my jacket more securely over myself as a chill in the air I haven't felt in god knows how long rushes over me. A breeze blows a snowflake onto my cheek, and I could almost cry. Instead I find myself doubling over as every nerve in my body reactivates. My eye, my arm... injuries that I had largely forgotten suddenly scream out. A warm trickle of blood flows down my cheek.//\n\n\n\n//Fighting through the pain, I activate the dormant .aic[[footnote]]Artificial Intelligence Construct, artificial intelligences developed to aid the Foundation in various tasks.[[/footnote]] frozen in the device on my wrist.//\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:**[[footnote]]Cruz.aic is a Foundation .aic developed specifically to interface with anomalous items and recreate their anomalous effects on a contained scale so they may be researched.[[/footnote]] Agent Kidd?

I didn't have a ton of offline records specifically on Aeternum since I don't normally get to touch \"deific\" stuff, but I do have a basic backup of the main Foundation database up to level 3 clearance. Seems the shrine was in the mountains to the northwest of here.\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Could you chart a route? Avoid Seattle if possible.\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:** Hm? Well, I guess I can.

It'll be over soon.//\n\n\n\n//I tap the sigil one last time.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** I'm ready.\n\n\n\n//I begin walking down the route Cruz maps out.

Kidd, we're--\n\n\n\n//Before Cruz can finish, we're surrounded by a group of men. They're no more than ten or so in number, each with a blade at their side. At their lead stands a tall, suited man, who looks at me with a smile.//\n\n\n\n**Man:** I should've guessed it was someone from your group out here. Good to see you, Agent Kidd. It's been far too long, have you been well?\n\n\n\n//I chuckle, my arms held up in surrender.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Agent Saul. I've been better, I gotta say.\n\n\n\n**Saul:** I'd gotten some intel that the Foundation had an operation in this area. Little did I realize it was going to be an old friend.\n\n\n\n//Agent Saul raises an eyebrow, his eyes falling on my eyepatch. He approaches me with a stony expression and draws his sword. Bringing the sword's tip to my chin, he tilts my head up slightly so I'm forced to meet his eyes.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** This is fresh, kid. Now how in the world did something like this happen?\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** You know how I draw those sigils, Saul. I was probably just careless last time-\n\n\n\n**Saul:** I'm not a fool, kid.

Before I can tumble back down properly, a hand grabs mine and pulls me up. I scramble over the edge of the ravine back onto solid ground.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Thank you, Agent Saul.\n\n\n\n**Saul:** You've got the map.

They remain stiff and unmoving as ever beneath my touch. I press my finger against the thorn of a holly bush as we pass by. Pulling my finger away I can see the small prick left on the tip, but nothing else. No sensation, no reactive pain. The same with the snow gathered atop the leaves-- there's no chill to their touch, nothing at all.//\n\n\n\n//I cast my eyes to the sky, seeing two songbirds frozen in place in the air.

You've been wandering every which way and it's starting to weird me out.\n\n\n\n//I shrug and keep walking, but he grabs my shoulder and stops me.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** When I talk, you answer me. I'm getting real tired of you acting all aloof out of nowhere.\n\n\n\n//I shake his hand off.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** I thought it was obvious, is all.

You seriously don't have a sword?!\n\n\n\n//We're fully surrounded by a group of men at this point.

They're a bunch of freaks who //really// love the collapse of societal order. They're real content with doing whatever the hell they please. Us Keepers are at least interested in //trying// to have a sense of order.\n\n\n\n//I swing my bat. It connects with my target's stomach.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Cruz, help me out. Escape route, minimal injuries possible.\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:** Gotcha, on it!\n\n\n\n//I change my strategy. I dodge and weave through jabs and swings as Cruz calculates. Saul's approach is more akin to a hurricane. He strikes with wild sweeping strikes designed to deal as much harm as possible. His blade pierces flesh, maximizing already fatal injuries. His opponents pay them no mind. The assault continues. The men, little more than living corpses, rise back to their feet as quickly as they're knocked over.//\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:** ...Got it! Bat to the left shoulder of the guy in front of you. Follow it with a shoulder tackle. Then move it!\n\n\n\n//I bring my bat down on the man's shoulder. What I don't realize is his existing injury. My bat is the last thing needed to completely remove his arm from his body.

I slam my shoulder against him, and send him toppling over.//\n\n\n\n//I can run.//\n\n\n\n//I// should //run. Run and get away, finish the mission.

Before I can react we're running. He's practically dragging me as we run off. Eventually we stop, certain we've left the rogues behind.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Saul, I-\n\n\n\n//He punches me, hard. I stagger back.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** You are a goddamn fool, kid. Time and time again you've shown me that it's frankly only by the grace of some higher power that you're still able to even move. What is it that you're trying to pull, anyway? Some attempt at mercy or something?\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** I just don't want to hurt people if I don't have to.\n\n\n\n**Saul:** You have a messiah complex or something? Convinced that you're the magical lamb set to save the world, eh? Redeem everyone of their sin? Get it through your thick skull. Those men wanted you as close to dead as someone can be in this world for no reason beyond the fact that they could.\n\n\n\n//He looks away from me, refusing to meet my eyes. I find myself doing the same.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** It's not up to me to condemn them. I know what it's like to be hurt, Saul, and I damn well know it more than you. When everything is back, the people still with us are going to feel every single thing they've missed since it all stopped. Every single nerve in their body is going to scream out as it comes back to life. I don't have the right to give that pain to people. If it means bearing a few injuries... if it means //I// have to hurt for them, then I'll do it.\n\n\n\n**Saul:** ...Cruz, where's the closest town to here?\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:** I don't need to tell you that.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[image Cruz6.png width=\"75px\" style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Humor me, I need to make a point.\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:** ...Due east.\n\n\n\n//Saul grabs my hand.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Follow me.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**Addendum 001.5:** February 13th, 2025 0710 hours[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n//Following Cruz's instructions, we head into a small suburb near the edge of the forest. It's quiet, as any suburb would be in the early morning. That said, the signs of a day in the process of beginning were visible. Children waiting at a bus stop, a man with coffee in his hand fumbling with car keys, a woman walking a dog... everyone in their morning routine. Stuck in that moment.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** I want you to see exactly what you're doing when you choose the coward's way out of a fight.\n\n\n\n//Agent Saul leads me over to the man fumbling with his keys.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Take a good, long look at the damage done here.\n\n\n\n//I oblige.

None life-threatening, nothing major, but fresh wounds regardless.//\n\n\n\n//I turn to Saul, ready to say... something, but he merely shakes his head and gestures to the rest. My fears are confirmed, every person outside bears similar fresh injuries on their body. Some are small, as if dealt by a hand that was merely curious as to what would happen, while others are deeper, dealt by a hand desperate for satisfaction. Finally I find my voice.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** //Why?//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** You //know// why, kid. There's real evil in the world, and there are people who just //pretend// they aren't evil until the conditions that keep them moral vanish. That's all those rogue groups are-- people who claimed morality until they got real bored and decided to take it out on everyone else. I spent enough of my time with the Foundation watching as they ignored things like this in favor of restoring their idea of \"normalcy\". This is what I mean when I say you need to get real already. If someone is trying to kill you, fight back.\n\n\n\n//He shoves me.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** The fact you're ignorant to all of this here says enough. Go ahead and condemn me from on high while you ignore the people down here, you and the rest of the Foundation.\n\n\n\n//He shoves me again, and I stumble back.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** You can go on making promises you can't keep to people you don't know, or you can wizen the hell up and make the most of the situation you're stuck in.\n\n\n\n//I struggle to respond as I continue to look at the proof around me. If I succeed in the end, if I actually complete this mission, what does it mean for the people here? Suddenly their world starts again, and they scream out from sudden pain they never deserved to feel.//\n\n\n\n//But even still...//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Can you really condemn people for lashing out under the worst circumstances that they could possibly be in?\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Ask any man fighting in any war with what they're fighting for, and I promise you not a single one can give you a real answer. Hell you could've asked me when I was still Foundation what it was that I believed in, and I'd just give you a slack-jawed \"for humanity\" response. The Keepers have made something new from all of that, we've made a proper society. We actually make an effort to deal with the people who do things like this while the Foundation sits on its hands fixating on the past. This?\n\n\n\n//He throws his arms out in vague motions.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** To you this is hell, I get it. Don't act like I don't understand your side at all. To me, however? This is //freedom//. We finally get a world with no pain, no hunger. Those rogues out there are proof that the worst in society cannot and will not change, but here at least when they harm us we don't have to feel it. We can go on living. I don't get how you can live through all of this and still think that mercy is an option.\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Cruz, how close is the nearest shoreline?\n\n\n\n**Cruz.aic:** Again with this?

Even slightly before dawn there are a few people out here, clearly outdoorsy types. Some brave enough to have taken off their shoes and dipped their feet into the frigid winter waters, a handful of kids chasing a flock of seagulls, and others simply watching from further up the beach. Another moment caught in time.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** What do you hear?\n\n\n\n//He frowns.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Nothing, obviously. That's a stupid question.\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Exactly. You //should// be hearing laughter, the cries of birds, the crashing of waves, but instead it's all dead silent.\n\n\n\n//I throw my arms out.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** This is what I'm fighting for. I'm fighting for a chance to //have// a future. I'm fighting for //this//. Moments like this.\u00a0\u00a0These moments of joy, of struggle, of sorrow... the things that make us human. I want everyone to have the ability to experience these things in their truest form again. Even you. It isn't about me, it never has been. I have the duty to leave a better world for the people who come after me, one where they have the ability to actually have something worth living for.\n\n\n\n//Agent Saul is quiet.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** There are really nasty people out there, Saul, I get it. I don't blame you for being jaded.\n\n\n\n//I flash him a weak smile, and walk towards the water itself. Saul follows, almost hesitant. When we reach the shoreline, I step out on top of the waves. The water is solid beneath my feet as I continue walking. Saul is hesitant, but eventually does the same. We both stand atop the water, looking back at the people on the beach.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** I'm willing to give up everything I have if it means everyone else can go on living and experiencing what it means to be alive. What we have now isn't that, Saul. What's life if people don't actually get to //feel// anything? //Experience// anything?

I want to hurt, I want to cry, I want feelings to numb deep down. There's another part of me, a part of me that wants to do something I'll be remembered for before I'm gone.

The old gods slowly faded as the old stories and rituals that once sustained them stopped getting passed down and were relegated to little more than fairytales.//\n\n\n\n//Saul had expected something grand when we crested the hill, signs that some great power had once resided here.

I collapse to the ground in agony as the pain from my all too fresh injuries racks my entire body. Saul drops to his knees as well, but pulls me in close.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Hey, hey, it's ok. I'm right here.\n\n\n\n//I take sharp, shallow breaths. My first in so long. I feel Saul against me, and finally my body relaxes.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** How does it feel?\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** E-everything hurts. So much. I feel so alive.\n\n\n\n//He laughs as a tear rolls down his cheek, and I find myself doing the same. He looks up, eyes on the rising sun.//\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Can't believe I let myself miss this for so long.\n\n\n\n//We're both quiet for a moment. A moment, and actual// real //moment.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** ...It's beautiful.\n\n\n\n//Another breeze blows, carrying the chirp of a songbird with it.//\n\n\n\n**Kidd:** Good morning, Saul.\n\n\n\n**Saul:** Good morning, Kidd.\n\n\n\n//I cry. I cry years and years worth of tears as Saul cradles me, acting as if he isn't just as hurt. He turns us off to the horizon, and we watch as the sun begins to rise.//\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 150%]]//The world breathes.//[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n[[size 200%]]February 13th, 2025 0711 hours[[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[image inthemorningsunMARG.jpg]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Cruz1-10.png\n\n> **Author:** OriTiefling\n\n> **License:** Creative Commons Share-Alike 3.0\n\n> **Additional Notes:** All Cruz icons are drawn by the original author, OriTiefling, and released under the CC by SA 3.0 license\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** inthemorningsunMarg.jpg\n\n> **Author:** LOVEMarginal\n\n> **License:** Creative Common Share-Alike 3.0\n\n> **Additional Notes:** Image was commissioned by the original author for use in this article and is released under the CC by SA 3.0 license.\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times.</p>\n<p>Teams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by proximity to the object.</p>\n<p>No personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via written authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver must be escorted by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and must temporarily surrender their rank and security clearance. Following contact, command staff will be escorted at least 5\u00a0km from SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. If deemed fit for return to duty by psych staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when quarantine expires.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60\u00a0m\u00b3 (or 2000 ft\u00b3). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.</p>\n<p>Refer to the Mulhausen Report [cross-ref:document00.023.603] for details related to object's discovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven personnel. It has also in its time at the facility further furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag chair, three books in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a variety of lab animals including higher primates have failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to produce any effect. Whatever process the subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings is apparently only facilitated by the introduction of living humans.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>view Mulhausen Report docid:00.023.603</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mulhausen Report [00.023.603]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is a brief report detailing the discovery of SCP-002</p>\n<p>Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal where it struck the Earth from orbit.

No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003.</p>\n<p>In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second growth stage.</p>\n<p>Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.</p>\n<p>SCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.</p>\n<p>SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a configuration similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions.</p>\n<p>SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2 are not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.</p>\n<p>SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly inaccessible without risk of damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types. SCP-003-2 contains an internal power source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several centuries before discovery.</p>\n<p>It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1. Partially interpreted data recovered from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1.</p>\n<p>SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's existence, possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures.</p>\n<p>When SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35\u00b0C, both components react.</p>\n<p>First, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth state consists of two stages. In both stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter around it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including atmospheric elements, then nonliving organic material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and other biological materials.</p>\n<p>The first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar in shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a central processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that appear to scan its surrounding environment, and will partially convert the area around it to an unidentified anomalous substance (SCP-003-2 seems immune from conversion).</p>\n<p>The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003 comes into contact with living organic material; SCP-003 appears to \"template\" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt communication with organisms that match its initial \"template\" or \"templates\".</p>\n<p>In its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic and nonliving organic elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their physical makeup.</p>\n<p>While growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage SCP-003-1's growth rate is diminished by 20-90% so long as SCP-003-1 remains in contact with living organic material. The percentage is determined by the complexity of the organism(s) in contact with SCP-003-1; SCP-003-1 appears to devote a large amount of processing power to analysis of living organic material.</p>\n<p>During each of SCP-003-1's growth stages, SCP-003-2 releases bursts of radiation that temporarily inhibit SCP-003-1's growth, or reverse this growth when the temperature of SCP-003-1 rises above 100\u00b0C. Similar radiation emissions have been replicated or recorded via other anomalous means.</p>\n<p>SCP-003-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant elements have been identified similar to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, <a href=\"/scp-1512\">SCP-1512</a>, and <a href=\"/scp-2756\">SCP-2756</a>, the latter two of which have no further confirmed connection with SCP-003-1 and no known connection with each other, and none of which are fully understood (technically, even less understood than SCP-003, thanks to the extensive cross-disciplinary research on the SCP-003 objects). To date, no convincing analysis has been put forward which satisfactorily explains SCP-003-1's connection to these SCP objects or others, nor its connection to modern technology beyond appearance (and potential mimicry via unknown mechanism).</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 003-01</strong>: Acting on information gathered from linguistic analysis of SCP-003-2's runes and comparative data analysis, Research Team M03-Gloria has managed to establish a link between SCP-003 and [DATA EXPUNGED] for analysis of functions. SCP-003-1 must now be considered sentient, and is to be kept a minimum of 1\u00a0km from [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting \"by-product\" at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 003-02</strong>: SCP-003-2's power loss has been exacerbated by the procedures performed by M03-Gloria. On orders of O5-10, M03-Gloria will continue procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 003-03</strong>: During M03-Gloria procedures, SCP-003-1 doubled its mass and began rapid structural growth. Temperature was immediately returned to 100\u00b0C. Growth and mass increase of SCP-003-1 continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds, at which time a sustained radiation spike was produced by SCP-003-2. In response, SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 3 minutes and 39 seconds. New growth dissolved into a dusty residue which was collected for analysis. Both SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2 ceased all detectable activity. SCP-003-2 did not resume activity until connected to external power source. SCP-003-2's runes glowed uniformly gray and did not resume normal activity for three (3) hours. SCP-003-2 no longer appears to be able to maintain containment area at a temperature above 35\u00b0C without external power supplied by Generators 003-III through IX.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 003-04</strong>: The procedure detailed in Addendum 003-03 was repeated, and SCP-003-1 again entered a growth state. After 10 minutes and 13 seconds, SCP-003-2 once again produced a sustained radiation spike. SCP-003-1's growth stopped for 36 seconds, then resumed at its previous pace.</p>\n<p>On quadrupling its mass, SCP-003-1 formed a coherent outer shell and body. After appearing to scan its environment and partially converting its environment, SCP-003-1 then breached containment, entering the observation gallery where nine members of M03-Gloria were present. On physical contact with team members, SCP-003-1 encompassed them in rapidly-grown appendages and stopped growth for 15 minutes. SCP-003-1 then resumed growth, and rearranged the component parts of the center of its form to the shape of a three-meter-tall female humanoid, with peripheral \"tentacles\" shifting to extrude primarily from SCP-003-1's newly formed \"hair\" and spine. SCP-003-1 then produced rudimentary vocalizations in an apparent initial attempt to communicate with researchers. [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>An unknown individual approached the compromised containment area in company of a full squad of agents. The individual claimed to be acting on orders of O5-10 and attempted communication with SCP-003-1. [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>Following this incident, Agent Jackson of M03-Gloria successfully restored power to SCP-003-2 and activated backup generators to return the temperature to 100\u00b0C. SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 21 minutes and 7 seconds, and was successfully re-contained without incident.</p>\n<p>All nine members of M03-Gloria affected by SCP-003-1 were afterwards found to be physically unharmed, with no residual effects besides psychological trauma. The converted materials of SCP-003's former containment area did not dissolve and are now under analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 003-05</strong>: In light of the previous incident, O5-10 was removed from the O5 Council by joint decision of O5-\u2588\u2588, O5-\u2588\u2588, and O5-\u2588\u2588.

No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003.\n\n\n\nIn event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second growth stage. \n\n\n\nPersonnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.\n\n\n\nSCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.\n\n\n\nSCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a configuration similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain conditions.\n\n\n\nSCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2 are not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.\n\n\n\nSCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly inaccessible without risk of damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types. SCP-003-2 contains an internal power source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several centuries before discovery.\n\n\n\nIt is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1. Partially interpreted data recovered from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1. \n\n\n\nSCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's existence, possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures.\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35\u00b0C, both components react. \n\n\n\nFirst, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth state consists of two stages. In both stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter around it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including atmospheric elements, then nonliving organic material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and other biological materials. \n\n\n\nThe first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar in shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a central processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that appear to scan its surrounding environment, and will partially convert the area around it to an unidentified anomalous substance (SCP-003-2 seems immune from conversion).\n\n\n\nThe second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003 comes into contact with living organic material; SCP-003 appears to \"template\" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt communication with organisms that match its initial \"template\" or \"templates\". \n\n\n\nIn its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic and nonliving organic elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their physical makeup.\n\n\n\nWhile growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage SCP-003-1's growth rate is diminished by 20-90% so long as SCP-003-1 remains in contact with living organic material. The percentage is determined by the complexity of the organism(s) in contact with SCP-003-1; SCP-003-1 appears to devote a large amount of processing power to analysis of living organic material.\n\n\n\nDuring each of SCP-003-1's growth stages, SCP-003-2 releases bursts of radiation that temporarily inhibit SCP-003-1's growth, or reverse this growth when the temperature of SCP-003-1 rises above 100\u00b0C.

Other parts of SCP-004-CAS01's body are found scattered as far as 32\u00a0km from the factory. Under interrogation, the apprehended juveniles tell authorities that upon opening the door with one of the keys, SCP-004-CAS01 was torn into several pieces, each of which disappeared. At this point, the SCP Foundation takes over the investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>07/04/1949</strong>: SCP Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 obtains the keys from the local authorities to begin testing. Tests show that SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13 all fit into a single lock on the large barred door. 12 Class D personnel are assigned to test the effects of the door. Of the twelve test subjects each trying a different key to enter the room, only two survive. Opening the door with any key except SCP-004-7 or SCP-004-12 caused the test subjects to be torn apart in multiple directions; however, no dismembered parts were found until later. At the time of writing, only two parts of each subject have been recovered (with the exception of the subject using SCP-004-\u2588, whose pieces were scattered in close proximity). The others have, for all intents and purposes, vanished from existence.</p>\n<p>Of the two surviving subjects, only one (having used SCP-004-7) returned unharmed. The other came back in a near-catatonic state, able only to remove himself from the room and then collapse on the floor, and had to be restrained to prevent him from gouging out his eyes (see Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004). The subject using SCP-004-7 said that he had entered a large room, impossibly big for the size of the attached building.

Backup of the SCP database has begun.</p>\n<p><strong>01/25/2001</strong>: Due to time anomalies (see \u201cSpace-Time Anomalies\u201d below), all personnel working at Site-62 are now required to reside on-site permanently. Families of personnel are to be informed that loved ones perished in an industrial accident. Cloned bodies have been prepared for funeral.</p>\n<p><strong>08/14/2003</strong>: Massive power outage across Northeast United States and through Canada. Due to the initial failure of multiple SCP generators, Site-62 was without power for fifty-three (53) minutes. During those fifty-three (53) minutes, those on site were completely without any source of light. They reported \"sensing\" creatures and people, although no abnormal entities could be seen or felt. Selected facility personnel were allowed to read \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (Appendix A) and said the creatures \"sensed\" were of humanoid size but otherwise similar to the massive green creature described.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc1\"><span>Space-Time Anomalies</span></h4>\n<p>SCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies. Personnel leaving the facility report losing time. Those who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several days, and records of work completed and supplies consumed support their claims. Other temporal anomalies involve SCP-004-2 through -13, especially the reappearance of SCP-004-CAS01 and SCP-004-CAS02 exactly \u2588\u2588 years after using SCP-004-\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies. Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7. Similarly, the 2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of existence within the same space that Site-62 occupies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Additional Notes</span></h4>\n<p>Testing on SCP-004 reveals that ten of the keys open SCP-004-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics and topology are significantly different than those of our home dimension. Test subjects meeting these hostile conditions are torn apart, their body parts deposited in various locations, only three of which have been verified to be on Earth. Material deposited at two of these points appears immediately; material deposited at the third appears exactly \u2588\u2588 years into the future. The other seven locations are currently unknown.</p>\n<p>Current testing focuses on two avenues of research. The first is finding ways to survive SCP-004\u2019s hostile topologies.

He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view. He reported innate fear and sudden recognition, \u201cas if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,\u201d and forced implantation of \u201cincomprehensible\u201d memories.

However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-005\">SCP-005</a>\" by Unknown Author, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

The following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact with it.</p>\n<p>1: All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.</p>\n<p>2: Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.</p>\n<p>3: Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.</p>\n<p>4: If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60\u00a0km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control.

    "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n++ Under direct orders of the founder, access is limited to those with Overseer clearance.\n\n\n\n**Overseer Clearance Granted**\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=SCP006_stream-new.jpg|caption=SCP-006|width=300px]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-006\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact with it.\n\n\n\n1: All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.\n\n\n\n2: Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.\n\n\n\n3: Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.\n\n\n\n4: If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property of \"health\". \n\n\n\nIngesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings: the ability to regenerate DNA damaged by sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities in the repair of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon testing the liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents were destroyed immediately. Many reptiles and birds were unaffected, while higher primates experienced the same benefits as humans.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-005]]] | SCP-006 | [[[SCP-007]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Unknown Author, rewritten by Epic Phail Spy and Proxtown]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** new006.jpg\n\n> **Author:** [[*user CityToast]]\n\n> **License:** CC-BY 3.0\n\n> **Derivative of:** \"\"[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ndongo_Stream.jpg Ndongo Stream]\"\", CC-BY-4.0\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

Room is to be furnished comfortably as a living area, along with whatever items are requested by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (hereafter referred to as Subject), given that providing Subject with requested items would not compromise security. Subject is not to be allowed to leave the room, and is to be detained with force if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-007 is located within a cavity in the abdomen of Subject. Subject is a Caucasian male, physically approximately 25 years of age (subject claims to be 28) and 176\u00a0cm in height. Most of Subject's abdomen (muscles, skin, and organs) is absent, though Subject does not appear to suffer because of this. Instead of normal flesh, a sphere composed of soil and water is present, though it does not actually come into contact with Subject's body at any point. The sphere appears to be, in most respects, a miniature near-duplicate of the Earth, approximately 60\u00a0cm in diameter, although continental alignment is not consistent with that of any alignment known in Earth's history. The sphere has its own weather patterns and negligible gravitational pull, in addition to microscopic organisms somewhat resembling those of modern-day Earth inhabiting it. Two intelligent species have been observed, though contact and communication with either has yet to be made. Technology levels of observed species must be checked at least once a week and, as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, are approximately equal to that of 15th-Century Earth.</p>\n<p>Subject claims to be named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, but no records of such a person can be found. Subject does not require food or water, and while he has been observed consuming both, what happens to such substances after being swallowed is unknown. Subject is intelligent (IQ has been measured at 128) and amiable, and regards the planet in his abdomen as a minor curiosity about his body. Subject seems to experience no stress about his unusual condition. When questioned about planet's origins, Subject replied, \"I just woke up one day, and there it was. I don't have any idea how it got there.\" Subject has provided a Social Security number and driver's license number and requested that they be checked against known records. When checked, it was discovered that neither had yet been allocated.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has a weekly chess game with Subject, during which Subject's mental health is evaluated. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reports that Subject does not seem to mind the restricted living environment, and has yet to attempt to escape or show signs of violence or mental illness, though he has repeatedly requested a computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that this not be provided as it may be used to compromise security.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-007\">SCP-007</a>\" by Unknown Author, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Room is to be furnished comfortably as a living area, along with whatever items are requested by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (hereafter referred to as Subject), given that providing Subject with requested items would not compromise security. Subject is not to be allowed to leave the room, and is to be detained with force if necessary. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-007 is located within a cavity in the abdomen of Subject. Subject is a Caucasian male, physically approximately 25 years of age (subject claims to be 28) and 176 cm in height. Most of Subject's abdomen (muscles, skin, and organs) is absent, though Subject does not appear to suffer because of this. Instead of normal flesh, a sphere composed of soil and water is present, though it does not actually come into contact with Subject's body at any point. The sphere appears to be, in most respects, a miniature near-duplicate of the Earth, approximately 60 cm in diameter, although continental alignment is not consistent with that of any alignment known in Earth's history. The sphere has its own weather patterns and negligible gravitational pull, in addition to microscopic organisms somewhat resembling those of modern-day Earth inhabiting it. Two intelligent species have been observed, though contact and communication with either has yet to be made. Technology levels of observed species must be checked at least once a week and, as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, are approximately equal to that of 15th-Century Earth. \n\n\n\nSubject claims to be named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, but no records of such a person can be found. Subject does not require food or water, and while he has been observed consuming both, what happens to such substances after being swallowed is unknown. Subject is intelligent (IQ has been measured at 128) and amiable, and regards the planet in his abdomen as a minor curiosity about his body. Subject seems to experience no stress about his unusual condition. When questioned about planet's origins, Subject replied, \"I just woke up one day, and there it was. I don't have any idea how it got there.\" Subject has provided a Social Security number and driver's license number and requested that they be checked against known records. When checked, it was discovered that neither had yet been allocated. \n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has a weekly chess game with Subject, during which Subject's mental health is evaluated. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reports that Subject does not seem to mind the restricted living environment, and has yet to attempt to escape or show signs of violence or mental illness, though he has repeatedly requested a computer with an internet connection. It is recommended that this not be provided as it may be used to compromise security.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-006]]] | SCP-007 | [[[SCP-008]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> |\n\nauthor=Unknown Author]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

Object's chamber is to be fitted with temperature sensors which must be monitored at all times, and is to be kept refrigerated by no fewer than three (3) redundant cooling units. Any malfunction of sensors, or of coolant systems, is to be reported and repaired immediately. If at any time the temperature in the containment area climbs above -5\u00b0C, the chamber is to be locked down and flooded with coolant until temperatures return to safe levels (-30\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C).</p>\n<p>Containment area is to be kept in total vacuum during testing, and personnel interacting with SCP-009 must wear full environmental protection gear. Following testing, all equipment, personnel, and other materials must undergo dehydration procedures and be quarantined for no less than 12 hours. Any moisture found displaying properties of SCP-009 is to be quarantined and added to the containment area as soon as possible. Living organisms found to be contaminated by SCP-009 are to be terminated by chemical dessication and extracted molecules of SCP-009 added to containment.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-009 is approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588 liters of a substance which superficially resembles distilled water (H<sub>2</sub>O), except with a distinct bright red hue. This red hue is discernible in all phases, and serves as the most expedient method of identifying contaminated matter before its anomalous properties manifest. In contrast to mundane water, SCP-009 assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100\u00b0C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam.</p>\n<p>Examinations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive. The substance appears to be identical to normal water molecules, with the exception of [REDACTED] in contrast to standard laws of enthalpy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Site \u2588\u2588's resident expert on Xenospatial Physics suggests that SCP-009 may originate in a universe with alternate physical laws.</p>\n<p>The most hazardous property of SCP-009, however, is its ability to contaminate normal H<sub>2</sub>O. When in contact with any aqueous solution, SCP-009 will, through unknown mechanisms, transfer its anomalous properties to other objects and creatures. Testing has shown it capable of assimilating ice, steam, tea, fruit juice, seawater, blood, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The time it takes for this process to occur varies depending on temperature and the exact chemical composition of affected matter, and had been observed as taking between 3 minutes and \u2588\u2588 hours.</p>\n<p>Experiments on D-Class personnel have illustrated the process of conversion by the substance, which has been found to follow a consistent pattern:</p>\n<p>1. Initial Exposure: Subject is exposed to SCP-009, and it begins assimilating any moisture present on the exposed surface. Creatures in this stage do not commonly notice any unusual symptoms except for a slight warming sensation.</p>\n<p>2. Surface Conversion: Frost begins to form on the exposed area as the heat produced by the subject and SCP-009 itself raises its temperature above 0\u00b0C. This stage can take anywhere from one (1) minute to \u2588 hours, during which time subjects begin to feel [REDACTED] crystals from the epidermis.</p>\n<p>3. Deep Tissue Conversion: Exponential increase in temperature of SCP-009 causes runaway reaction throughout subject's body, resulting in [REDACTED]. Actual blood loss is minimal due to ice crystals [REDACTED], allowing subjects to remain alive and conscious for up to \u2588\u2588 hours.</p>\n<p>4. [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>Testing on D-Class personnel was discontinued as of 4/23/20\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum: Circumstances of Retrieval:</strong> Subject was found in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Alaska, on 11/05/19\u2588\u2588. The Foundation became involved after reports were obtained from the native \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Tribe, who came across the mangled bodies of a team of seal hunters which had apparently been ship-wrecked \u2588\u2588 kilometers from the village.</p>\n<p>All victims were found encased in red ice. Cause of death recorded as internal bleeding, though closer examination found [REDACTED]. It is surmised that the low ambient temperatures in the area retarded the freezing process. This prolonged the time to total conversion by \u2588\u2588 hours, and allowed the victims to remain conscious until [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p>Origin of SCP-009 is currently unknown. Investigation into similar events or materials in the area is ongoing. Evidence at the scene suggests [REDACTED], possibly involving SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"/exploration-log-a009-1\">Exploration Log A009-1</a> for details.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> 11/09/19\u2588\u2588<br/>\nAfter initial report and retrieval of specimens, it was confirmed that the arachnoid entity found by MTF-B7 (see <a href=\"/exploration-log-a009-1\">attached file</a>) was indeed a previously unknown instance of <a href=\"/scp-3023\">SCP-3023</a>. Investigation has revealed the instance originated in [REDACTED] as a result of [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> 12/06/19\u2588\u2588<br/>\nAfter repeated inquiries, it should be noted that the portion of coastline upon which the initial victims were found was barren rock approximately \u2588 meters from the seashore, and was sufficiently dry and cold to prevent significant contamination of the surrounding area. Had the site been closer to the water, there is little doubt an extinction-level event would have ensued.</p>\n<p>Consideration of upgrading SCP-009 to Keter class under review.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> 12/16/20\u2588\u2588<br/>\nSuper-cooling of SCP-009 for the purposes of experimentation is disallowed until further notice. Personnel are advised that liquid nitrogen is only to be used on the subject in controlled amounts, and only until temperatures have reached acceptable levels.</p>\n<p>Related note: Possible application of SCP-009 in cold fusion research pending evaluation.</p>\n<p><strong>Memo from O-5 Command:</strong> 1/09/20\u2588\u2588<br/>\nWe've decided to keep this thing Euclid for now. We understand the concerns raised, but as long as you keep the power on and nobody goes near its containment area, there shouldn't be a problem. That's why we're keeping it in Site \u2588\u2588, after all.</p>\n<p>As for the cold fusion research, we're putting a pin in that for now. Frankly, we don't have it in the budget for another SNAFU like Site \u2588\u2588. The salvage team still hasn't found Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's [REDACTED]</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Cross-Testing\u00a0report\u00a09507F23</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u00a0Hide\u00a0Report</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>The following experiment record was recovered via a chance occurrence of <a href=\"/scp-507\">SCP-507</a> shifting into a universe in which the described test was carried out using <a href=\"/scp-107\">SCP-107</a>. The applicability of the reported findings to our own universe is pending review.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Input:</strong> 10mL of SCP-009<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> \"Red snow\" fell in test area for 27 minutes with moderate intensity. Grass growing in test area began runaway reaction which ended with entire area being \"frozen\" within minutes. Notably, anti-enthalpathic reaction of SCP-009 did not extend past the effective radius of <a href=\"/scp-107\">SCP-107</a>, for reasons still under investigation. Non-grass plants in area turned bright red in color, greatly expanded, and mutated to display cyan-colored \"tentacles\" similar to those of species <em>Drosera capensis</em>. Mucilage produced by these tentacles later found to be tiny beads of SCP-009. How the plant is able to survive with SCP-009 integrated into its cell structure is currently under investigation, with preliminary hypothesis being the plant is a reflection of flora from the substance's native universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-009\">SCP-009</a>\" by Chameleon X, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Object's chamber is to be fitted with temperature sensors which must be monitored at all times, and is to be kept refrigerated by no fewer than three (3) redundant cooling units. Any malfunction of sensors, or of coolant systems, is to be reported and repaired immediately. If at any time the temperature in the containment area climbs above -5\u00b0C, the chamber is to be locked down and flooded with coolant until temperatures return to safe levels (-30\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C). \n\n\n\nContainment area is to be kept in total vacuum during testing, and personnel interacting with SCP-009 must wear full environmental protection gear. Following testing, all equipment, personnel, and other materials must undergo dehydration procedures and be quarantined for no less than 12 hours. Any moisture found displaying properties of SCP-009 is to be quarantined and added to the containment area as soon as possible. Living organisms found to be contaminated by SCP-009 are to be terminated by chemical dessication and extracted molecules of SCP-009 added to containment.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-009 is approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0\u00a0liters of a substance which superficially resembles distilled water (H,,2,,O), except with a distinct bright red hue. This red hue is discernible in all phases, and serves as the most expedient method of identifying contaminated matter before its anomalous properties manifest.\u00a0\u00a0In contrast to mundane water, SCP-009 assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100\u00b0C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam.\n\n\n\nExaminations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive. The substance appears to be identical to normal water molecules, with the exception of [REDACTED] in contrast to standard laws of enthalpy. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Site \u2588\u2588's resident expert on Xenospatial Physics suggests that SCP-009 may originate in a universe with alternate physical laws.\n\n\n\nThe most hazardous property of SCP-009, however, is its ability to contaminate normal H,,2,,O. When in contact with any aqueous solution, SCP-009 will, through unknown mechanisms, transfer its anomalous properties to other objects and creatures. Testing has shown it capable of assimilating ice, steam, tea, fruit juice, seawater, blood, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The time it takes for this process to occur varies depending on temperature and the exact chemical composition of affected matter, and had been observed as taking between 3 minutes and \u2588\u2588 hours.\n\n\n\nExperiments on D-Class personnel have illustrated the process of conversion by the substance, which has been found to follow a consistent pattern:\n\n\n\n1. Initial Exposure: Subject is exposed to SCP-009, and it begins assimilating any moisture present on the exposed surface. Creatures in this stage do not commonly notice any unusual symptoms except for a slight warming sensation.\n\n\n\n2. Surface Conversion: Frost begins to form on the exposed area as the heat produced by the subject and SCP-009 itself raises its temperature above 0\u00b0C.\u00a0\u00a0This stage can take anywhere from one (1) minute to \u2588 hours, during which time subjects begin to feel [REDACTED] crystals from the epidermis.\n\n\n\n3. Deep Tissue Conversion: Exponential increase in temperature of SCP-009 causes runaway reaction throughout subject's body, resulting in [REDACTED]. Actual blood loss is minimal due to ice crystals [REDACTED], allowing subjects to remain alive and conscious for up to \u2588\u2588 hours.\n\n\n\n4. [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nTesting on D-Class personnel was discontinued as of 4/23/20\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n**Addendum: Circumstances of Retrieval:** Subject was found in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Alaska, on 11/05/19\u2588\u2588. The Foundation became involved after reports were obtained from the native \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Tribe, who came across the mangled bodies of a team of seal hunters which had apparently been ship-wrecked \u2588\u2588 kilometers from the village. \n\n\n\nAll victims were found encased in red ice. Cause of death recorded as internal bleeding, though closer examination found [REDACTED]. It is surmised that the low ambient temperatures in the area retarded the freezing process. This prolonged the time to total conversion by \u2588\u2588 hours, and allowed the victims to remain conscious until [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\nOrigin of SCP-009 is currently unknown. Investigation into similar events or materials in the area is ongoing. Evidence at the scene suggests [REDACTED], possibly involving SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\nSee [[[Exploration Log A009-1]]] for details.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** 11/09/19\u2588\u2588\n\nAfter initial report and retrieval of specimens, it was confirmed that the arachnoid entity found by MTF-B7 (see [[[Exploration Log A009-1| attached file]]]) was indeed a previously unknown instance of [[[SCP-3023]]]. Investigation has revealed the instance originated in [REDACTED] as a result of [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** 12/06/19\u2588\u2588\n\nAfter repeated inquiries, it should be noted that the portion of coastline upon which the initial victims were found was barren rock approximately \u2588 meters from the seashore, and was sufficiently dry and cold to prevent significant contamination of the surrounding area. Had the site been closer to the water, there is little doubt an extinction-level event would have ensued. \n\n\n\nConsideration of upgrading SCP-009 to Keter class under review.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** 12/16/20\u2588\u2588\n\nSuper-cooling of SCP-009 for the purposes of experimentation is disallowed until further notice. Personnel are advised that liquid nitrogen is only to be used on the subject in controlled amounts, and only until temperatures have reached acceptable levels. \n\n\n\nRelated note: Possible application of SCP-009 in cold fusion research pending evaluation.\n\n\n\n**Memo from O-5 Command:** 1/09/20\u2588\u2588\n\nWe've decided to keep this thing Euclid for now. We understand the concerns raised, but as long as you keep the power on and nobody goes near its containment area, there shouldn't be a problem. That's why we're keeping it in Site \u2588\u2588, after all. \n\n\n\nAs for the cold fusion research, we're putting a pin in that for now. Frankly, we don't have it in the budget for another SNAFU like Site \u2588\u2588. The salvage team still hasn't found Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's [REDACTED]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Cross-Testing report 9507F23\" hide=\" Hide Report\"]]\n\nThe following experiment record was recovered via a chance occurrence of [[[SCP-507]]] shifting into a universe in which the described test was carried out using [[[SCP-107]]]. The applicability of the reported findings to our own universe is pending review.\n\n> **Input:** 10mL of SCP-009\n\n> **Result:** \"Red snow\" fell in test area for 27 minutes with moderate intensity. Grass growing in test area began runaway reaction which ended with entire area being \"frozen\" within minutes. Notably, anti-enthalpathic reaction of SCP-009 did not extend past the effective radius of [[[SCP-107]]], for reasons still under investigation. Non-grass plants in area turned bright red in color, greatly expanded, and mutated to display cyan-colored \"tentacles\" similar to those of species //Drosera capensis//. Mucilage produced by these tentacles later found to be tiny beads of SCP-009. How the plant is able to survive with SCP-009 integrated into its cell structure is currently under investigation, with preliminary hypothesis being the plant is a reflection of flora from the substance's native universe.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-008]]] | SCP-009 | [[[SCP-010]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 009.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user S D Locke]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> \n\n> **Derivative of:** Apostle Islands National Lakeshore - Ice Caves\n\n> **Author:** The Cut\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/63875512@N04/16032247730|Flickr]]]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

They are not to be worn except by test subjects.</p>\n<p>SCP-010 are only to be removed from storage for testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-010 consists of a series of six (6) apparently identical cast iron collars with numbered metal tags and one (1) remote control. The control is SCP-010-1. The collars are SCP-010-2 through 010-7. The collars contain intricate electronic components and are powered by small (5\u00a0mm diameter, 2\u00a0mm thick) 100\u00a0V batteries. These batteries are rechargeable.</p>\n<p>The remote is a heavy black box resembling an old style hand-held radio transmitter/receiver with a primitive blue/white cathode ray screen and a series of more than 100 unlabeled buttons, as well as a frequency tuner. Through trial and error, the frequencies of all six (6) currently found collars have been discovered. A label in Russian is stamped into the metal along with a logo consisting of workers building a pyramid. No official Russian corporation or government agency uses this logo or matches the words stamped into the metal.</p>\n<p>Placing the collar around the neck of a person and securing it allows one to control their every movement with the remote. It is also capable of producing an adrenal response and activating or deactivating the sympathetic nervous system. The most abnormal feature of the collars is the effect they have on the body morphology.

    "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-010\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The objects comprising SCP-010 are to be kept in numbered locked boxes at Site-19. They are not to be worn except by test subjects.\n\n\n\nSCP-010 are only to be removed from storage for testing.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-010 consists of a series of six (6) apparently identical cast iron collars with numbered metal tags and one (1) remote control. The control is SCP-010-1. The collars are SCP-010-2 through 010-7. The collars contain intricate electronic components and are powered by small (5 mm diameter, 2 mm thick) 100 V batteries. These batteries are rechargeable.\n\n\n\nThe remote is a heavy black box resembling an old style hand-held radio transmitter/receiver with a primitive blue/white cathode ray screen and a series of more than 100 unlabeled buttons, as well as a frequency tuner. Through trial and error, the frequencies of all six (6) currently found collars have been discovered. A label in Russian is stamped into the metal along with a logo consisting of workers building a pyramid. No official Russian corporation or government agency uses this logo or matches the words stamped into the metal.\n\n\n\nPlacing the collar around the neck of a person and securing it allows one to control their every movement with the remote. It is also capable of producing an adrenal response and activating or deactivating the sympathetic nervous system. The most abnormal feature of the collars is the effect they have on the body morphology. They allow the user of the remote to reconfigure the shape of the victim to an extent that is apparently only limited by the knowledge of the programming language of the remote.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 010-1:** History\n\n\n\nSCP-010 was discovered in the basement of a lone man in the Midwestern United States after a local disappearance was connected to him. When the police raided the man's house they found SCP-010 as well as several dead bodies. One of the bodies was identified to be the man. The others were several other missing persons. Cause of death seemed to be mass suicide; however, there were signs of significant struggle first.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 010-2:** Disassemble experiment\n\n\n\nTest 1: SCP-010-2 taken apart piecewise, the parts labeled and several photographs taken, then reassembled.\n\nResult: After reassembly SCP-010-2 continues to function.\n\n\n\nTest 2: SCP-010-8 constructed identically to SCP-010-2 but with the closest approximations available to the unreplicable components.\n\nResult: SCP-010-8 fails to function.\n\n\n\nTest 3: Unreplicable components from SCP-010-2 placed into proper locations on SCP-010-8.\n\nResult: SCP-010-2 ceases functioning with removal of components. SCP-010-8 begins functioning.\n\n\n\nTest 4: Components returned to SCP-010-2. Replicable components in SCP-010-2 replaced randomly with replicas\n\nResult: SCP-010-2 begins functioning with return of components. Changing replicable components for replicas does not significantly reduce functionality. Replacement of a damaged transistor decreased time from transmission to effect of SCP-010-2 response to commands entered in the remote by 12%.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 010-3:**\n\n\n\n//SCP-010 has been demonstrated to work more effectively in creating unskilled labor than for any other task.

For safety purposes, cleaning should start at least 30 minutes after sundown. Cleaning should always be performed by at least two (2) personnel, who are also advised to note anything unusual about the item or the debris cleaned up. In a situation where the item cannot be cleaned for more than two (2) days, local residents must be contacted and instructed not to approach the item.</p>\n<p>[Containment procedures nullified 2004]</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-011 is a Civil War memorial statue located in Woodstock, Vermont. The statue is the image of a young male soldier holding a musket at his side, and is carved out of granite quarried within the area. Occasionally, SCP-011 has been observed lifting its musket to the sky to fire at birds which attempt to land or defecate on it. Reports detail that its movements produce soft grinding sounds but do not cause it any structural failure. Oddly, the gunfire is very similar to that of a standard firearm, despite observations that the item only loads granite bullets and granite powder into the musket (which is also unharmed by the firing). In spite of its efforts, some fecal matter does manage to strike SCP-011, and it has reportedly become distressed when it has had a large amount of feces on it, on some rare occasions even firing at humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Those assigned to maintain SCP-011 are to see document #011-1 for instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Document #011-1: Maintenance Brief</strong></p>\n<p>[Document archived 2004 - accessible to personnel with security clearance 2/011 or higher]</p>\n<p>Additional Information: SCP-011's seeming sentience has increased since the first report of activity in 1995.

For safety purposes, cleaning should start at least 30 minutes after sundown. Cleaning should always be performed by at least two (2) personnel, who are also advised to note anything unusual about the item or the debris cleaned up. In a situation where the item cannot be cleaned for more than two (2) days, local residents must be contacted and instructed not to approach the item.\n\n\n\n[Containment procedures nullified 2004]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-011 is a Civil War memorial statue located in Woodstock, Vermont. The statue is the image of a young male soldier holding a musket at his side, and is carved out of granite quarried within the area. Occasionally, SCP-011 has been observed lifting its musket to the sky to fire at birds which attempt to land or defecate on it. Reports detail that its movements produce soft grinding sounds but do not cause it any structural failure. Oddly, the gunfire is very similar to that of a standard firearm, despite observations that the item only loads granite bullets and granite powder into the musket (which is also unharmed by the firing). In spite of its efforts, some fecal matter does manage to strike SCP-011, and it has reportedly become distressed when it has had a large amount of feces on it, on some rare occasions even firing at humans.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Those assigned to maintain SCP-011 are to see document #011-1 for instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Document #011-1: Maintenance Brief**\n\n\n\n[Document archived 2004 - accessible to personnel with security clearance 2/011 or higher]\n\n\n\nAdditional Information: SCP-011's seeming sentience has increased since the first report of activity in 1995. As of 2004, the item's containment procedures have been dropped but it remains under constant observation. Recorded below are landmark events in its activity.\n\n\n\n>\n\n> \n\n> Timeline:\n\n> 3.12.1995 - Woodstock resident reports the statue's eyes moving, first sign of activity\n\n> 9.30.1995 - Statue shoots musket for the first time\n\n> 10.9.1995 - Statue begins shooting birds from the sky\n\n> 1.25.1996 - Registration as SCP-011, containment procedures begin\n\n> 4.14.1997 - SCP-011 observed moving casually and looking around\n\n> 5.3.2000 - After caretaker \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 jokingly shouts \"Good shot!\" to SCP-011, the item replies, \"Thank you,\" in a reportedly very human voice, first speech from statue\n\n> 10.22.2001 - SCP-011 has conversation with caretaker \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> 2001 - Shooting of birds stops\n\n> 2.6.2002 - At the imploring of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-011 steps down from its pedestal\n\n> 2003-2004 - SCP-011 reaches a human level of self-awareness\n\n> 11.10.2004 - Containment procedures dropped, custody of SCP-011 transferred to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> 5.17.2005 - \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 reports that SCP-011 is romantically attracted to her\n\n> 8.29.2006 - Most recent psych test reports an IQ of 133\n\n>\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-010]]] | SCP-011 | [[[SCP-012]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Proxtown]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** SCP011.jpg\n\n> **Author:** nthdayoncaprica (Reddit)\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/birndg/visited_011_yesterday/\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

Music should be supplied on a regular basis, preferably constantly. This music should not include pieces originating after 1937. A security camera should be present in SCP-014's room.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-014 is a Caucasian male, appearing to be approximately 30 years of age, with black hair, brown eyes, and a somewhat round face. Records indicate his name to be Robert Chetford, confined in 1915 to the Norwich Asylum in Connecticut for delusional insanity, claiming that he had been cursed to live forever, and was slowly turning into concrete in consequence. The asylum closed in 1937, and the patients were transferred to various other facilities. SCP-014 came to Foundation attention in 19\u2588\u2588, from rumours of a patient who seemed to be entirely immobile and showed no signs of aging. Further investigation determined that acquisition was warranted.</p>\n<p>SCP-014 is to all outward appearances a normal man, but he does not appear to age, and shows no signs of possessing a metabolism. He does not eat, drink, perspire, or in any other way demonstrate life functions. He breathes only to speak, and apart from his eyes and vocal apparatus, is to all appearances utterly immobile. He has never shown any evidence of pressure ulcers despite his position not having varied for several decades; neither do his muscles appear atrophied. He can converse normally, but shows little knowledge of or interest in events since his confinement.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong><br/>\n<em>Note: Frankly, were I to interview this man without knowing his history, I'd think he was a perfectly sane and well-adjusted individual who happens to be quadriplegic. As it is, I have to conclude that he's the ultimate proof of the idea that the mind rules the body. He thinks he's concrete, and will live forever, and so he's as close to both as he can be. Somehow.<br/>\n-Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-014\">SCP-014</a>\" by Whitewings, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Music should be supplied on a regular basis, preferably constantly. This music should not include pieces originating after 1937. A security camera should be present in SCP-014's room.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-014 is a Caucasian male, appearing to be approximately 30 years of age, with black hair, brown eyes, and a somewhat round face. Records indicate his name to be Robert Chetford, confined in 1915 to the Norwich Asylum in Connecticut for delusional insanity, claiming that he had been cursed to live forever, and was slowly turning into concrete in consequence. The asylum closed in 1937, and the patients were transferred to various other facilities. SCP-014 came to Foundation attention in 19\u2588\u2588, from rumours of a patient who seemed to be entirely immobile and showed no signs of aging. Further investigation determined that acquisition was warranted.\n\n\n\nSCP-014 is to all outward appearances a normal man, but he does not appear to age, and shows no signs of possessing a metabolism. He does not eat, drink, perspire, or in any other way demonstrate life functions. He breathes only to speak, and apart from his eyes and vocal apparatus, is to all appearances utterly immobile. He has never shown any evidence of pressure ulcers despite his position not having varied for several decades; neither do his muscles appear atrophied. He can converse normally, but shows little knowledge of or interest in events since his confinement.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n//Note: Frankly, were I to interview this man without knowing his history, I'd think he was a perfectly sane and well-adjusted individual who happens to be quadriplegic. As it is, I have to conclude that he's the ultimate proof of the idea that the mind rules the body. He thinks he's concrete, and will live forever, and so he's as close to both as he can be. Somehow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588//\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-013]]] | SCP-014 | [[[SCP-015]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 3241597616_e47326fc1a-new.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Damaged photostrip of a young man\n\n> **Author:** simpleinsomnia\n\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/simpleinsomnia/18190564919/ Flickr]\n\n> **Additional Notes:** Image color-shifted red.\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

A gap of at least 2\u00a0m (6 ft) needs to be maintained around the entire structure containing SCP-015 at all times, and no structures of any kind are to make contact with SCP-015's current containment structure. Exploration is permissible, but only in teams of three (3) with full safety lines and GPS tracking. Any protrusions from SCP-015 must be capped and sealed immediately, with the new site recorded and logged.</p>\n<p>No aggressive action is to be made within SCP-015. No hand or power tools are allowed anywhere inside SCP-015. No repairs or maintenance are to be made anywhere on SCP-015.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-015 is a mass of pipes, vents, boilers and other various plumbing apparatus completely filling a warehouse in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The pipes appear to grow when not under observation, attempting to connect to nearby structures via sewer systems and underground plumbing. SCP-015 contains, at current estimate, over 190 kilometers (120 miles) of pipes, ranging in diameter from 2.5\u00a0cm to over 1\u00a0m. Some pipes appear new, while others are rusted and leaking. Pipes have been reported as being made of bone, wood, steel, pressed ash, human flesh, glass, and granite. No pipes composed of lead, PVC plastic, copper, or any other traditional material for the production of pipes have been found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/plumbing\">SCP-015 reacts to tools and aggression.</a> Any personnel acting violently, carrying tools, or attempting to damage or repair SCP-015 in any way, will trigger a reaction. Any pipes near the subject will burst, spraying on the subject for several seconds before the flow suddenly stops. Pipes have been reported containing oil, mercury, rats, a species of insect not yet identified, ground glass, sea water, entrails, and molten iron. Pipes will continue to burst around the subject until death or retreat.</p>\n<p>SCP-015 was cut back to its current structure after attaching to 11 other structures in the area. Currently, 11 personnel have been killed, and 20 more are still missing. Reports have been made of banging and screaming coming from within SCP-015.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-015\">SCP-015</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Said wound became contaminated with coal dust from the mine, possibly infecting the worker with dormant spores. Over the next several days, SCP-016 proceeded to infect the remaining employees at the mining camp, as well as the CDC crisis team dispatched to deal with the epidemic. Foundation personnel then took over the investigation and terminated all affected personnel. Patient Zero was brought into captivity, and the mine shaft was collapsed by an explosive device.</p>\n<p>SCP-016 has an incubation period ranging from 24 hours to two (2) years, depending on the presence and number of other human hosts in the area. First symptoms resemble the common cold, and include itchy eyes, runny nose, coughing, and bodily aches. Phase two begins in 48 hours, and consists of a controlled form of hemorrhagic fever, as the organism causes a small amount of blood to become aspirated in the lungs, creating an aerosol effect. During phase three, the host \"crashes and bleeds out,\" bleeding profusely from every bodily orifice, including the nose, tear ducts, anus, skin pores, mouth, urethra, and (in case of females) vagina. Blood pressure skyrockets during the final stage: hosts have been observed projectile vomiting blood to distances of over five (5) meters. Should the host survive this near-total exsanguination, the pathogen will become dormant once more, returning to incubation phase.</p>\n<p>What distinguishes SCP-016 from other strains of hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola and Marburg is its unusual response to high stress. Should the subject undergo a high-stress situation (such as a life-threatening crisis), the organism will change its survival tactic from rapid reproduction to the rewriting of the host's DNA and stimulation of rapid cell division. Major physiological changes occur within the first 24 hours, with complete bodily reconstruction occurring within two (2) weeks time. Most hosts do not survive the process due to the heavy demands made on the body.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>An interesting side effect of the transformation is an increased aggressive urge.

The sealed box is then submerged in the center of the 10\u00a0m by 10\u00a0m by 10\u00a0m polyethylene holding tank. If SCP-018 is to break free from the holding box, the polyethylene-based 'goo' will slow down kinetic activity enough for proper retrieval by containment personnel. Personnel entering SCP-018's holding chamber are to wear specialized plating (found inside of SCP-018 Observation), and a breathing apparatus before being lowered into the polyethylene tank. If SCP-018 is loose outside of the polyethylene tank, personnel are advised to secure themselves in a separate room and close doorways or hatches to isolate SCP-018 until containment teams arrive.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-018 has the appearance of a Super Ball made by the Wham-O company in 1969. It is six (6) centimeters in diameter and coloured red. Found when the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 company was hired to clean out a warehouse that had Wham-O merchandise in it, SCP-018 was noted to be able to bounce with extreme height. At first thought to be a pleasant child's toy, SCP-018 was able to bounce with over two hundred percent (200%) efficiency (that is, if dropped one (1) meter, it would bounce two (2), then four (4), then eight (8), then sixteen (16)). The ball soon became a dangerous projectile, reaching speeds estimated at over 100\u00a0km/h and damaging property and injuring five (5) in the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It came to a rest after several days in the nearby lake of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and was retrieved by SCP personnel. Due to the speed of the object, and the total surprise by its victims, no cover-up story was required or initiated.</p>\n<p><strong>Document #018-04:</strong> Message to O5-\u2588</p>\n<p><em>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I hope everything is well.

Just hear me out, we implant it into the bottom of a boot, rig up a little bit of a mechanical device, and ta-da, the suit is now capable of jumping well over a building. Also, if the wearer has their foot against something they want dead, well, let's just say it delivers a helluva kick.

However, due to a malfunction of your 'little mechanical device', he was launched almost a mile into the air and suffered two broken legs, seven broken ribs, a missing arm, and a skull fracture upon hitting the water of Lake \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on the way back down. You will fix that before I authorize your armor for common use.//\n\n\n\n**Document #018-11:** Message to O5-\u2588\n\n\n\n//\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, don't worry, it's fixed. But, I have some more ideas. If I can be granted the use of some water from [[[SCP-006]]], SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and possibly SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, I can deliver you a set of SCP-A5 armor and an agent that can capture any, if not all, rogue or unattained SCPs. All I'm waiting on is your approval.//\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-017]]] | SCP-018 | [[[SCP-019]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Epic Phail Spy]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** superball.jpg\n\n> **Name:** SB 001\n\n> **Author:** Lenore Edman\n\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lenore-m/441554240]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

Room is to be kept at zero (0) degrees Celsius when incinerator is not activated. An observation chamber separated by a plate glass window is to be used for constant observation of SCP-019, and if/when specimens of SCP-019-2 are observed, the incinerator is to be activated. In the event of an outbreak of SCP-019-2, ordinary firearms are successful in terminating individual specimens, although in the case of a swarm-level outbreak, flamethrowers may be more effective. SCP-019 should be kept in a vertical position at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-019 appears to be a very large ceramic vase, 1.8\u00a0m in diameter at the mouth and 2.4\u00a0m high. Style and decoration indicate it was created in Classical Greece, although conclusive dating is impossible, as the surface is entirely unbreakable by any known means. If a successful method is discovered, SCP-019 is to be destroyed with prejudice.</p>\n<p>Periodically, entities emerge from SCP-019. Collectively, these are known as SCP-019-2. The entities vary in many aspects, but tend to be small, vaguely humanoid (though they may have animaloid features), and extremely hostile. They often choose to attack with teeth or claws. Although fairly delicate (also, surprisingly, flammable), they are reasonably strong and pose a considerable threat in large numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"scp-019-2-new.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-019/scp-019-2-new.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>SCP-019-2 specimen</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>When kept at zero (0) degrees Celsius and totally at rest, entities will emerge from SCP-019 at a rate of approximately one (1) entity per hour. The following traits are known to affect SCP-019-2's manifestation rate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Movement of SCP-019</li>\n<li>Threat to SCP-019</li>\n<li>Extreme temperature highs and lows</li>\n<li>Sudden shift in surrounding environment</li>\n<li>Introduction of objects or organisms to the inside of SCP-019 (known to cause a \u201cflood\u201d reaction)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traits that may or may not influence SCP-019-2's manifestation rate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presence of human life near SCP-019</li>\n<li>Current weather patterns</li>\n<li>Specific individuals near SCP-019 (some individuals seem to affect SCP-019-2's emergence rate more drastically than others)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, tipping or tilting SCP-019 will create a reaction as though it was previously \u201cfilled\u201d with SCP-019-2 specimens, although viewers looking into SCP-019 from above will merely observe a dark hole. Due to the production rates of SCP-019-2 when the object is disturbed, measurement of the internal cavity is difficult, but it is suspected to be inconsistent with outside measurements.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Document SCP-019-2-A<br/>\nSCP-019-2 notes, as maintained by Doctor Light and Doctor Vaux</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nSCP-019-2 specimen was removed from containment chamber and kept in reinforced pen, provided with water and live chickens as food. Specimen made quiet, continuous, garbled vocalizations, determined to be phonetically similar to Ancient Hellenic languages. Although the reason for this is unknown, specimens are still thought to be no more intelligent than animals.</p>\n<p>The specimen lived for less than 48 hours, and a dissection revealed anatomy consistent on a cellular level with normal biology, but with an extremely unstable musculoskeletal structure.

Room is to be kept at zero (0) degrees Celsius when incinerator is not activated. An observation chamber separated by a plate glass window is to be used for constant observation of SCP-019, and if/when specimens of SCP-019-2 are observed, the incinerator is to be activated. In the event of an outbreak of SCP-019-2, ordinary firearms are successful in terminating individual specimens, although in the case of a swarm-level outbreak, flamethrowers may be more effective. SCP-019 should be kept in a vertical position at all times.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-019 appears to be a very large ceramic vase, 1.8 m in diameter at the mouth and 2.4 m high. Style and decoration indicate it was created in Classical Greece, although conclusive dating is impossible, as the surface is entirely unbreakable by any known means. If a successful method is discovered, SCP-019 is to be destroyed with prejudice.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, entities emerge from SCP-019. Collectively, these are known as SCP-019-2. The entities vary in many aspects, but tend to be small, vaguely humanoid (though they may have animaloid features), and extremely hostile. They often choose to attack with teeth or claws. Although fairly delicate (also, surprisingly, flammable), they are reasonably strong and pose a considerable threat in large numbers. \n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=scp-019-2-new.jpg|caption=SCP-019-2 specimen]]\n\n\n\nWhen kept at zero (0) degrees Celsius and totally at rest, entities will emerge from SCP-019 at a rate of approximately one (1) entity per hour. The following traits are known to affect SCP-019-2's manifestation rate:\n\n* Movement of SCP-019\n\n* Threat to SCP-019\n\n* Extreme temperature highs and lows\n\n* Sudden shift in surrounding environment\n\n* Introduction of objects or organisms to the inside of SCP-019 (known to cause a \u201cflood\u201d reaction)\n\n\n\nTraits that may or may not influence SCP-019-2's manifestation rate:\n\n* Presence of human life near SCP-019\n\n* Current weather patterns\n\n* Specific individuals near SCP-019 (some individuals seem to affect SCP-019-2's emergence rate more drastically than others)\n\n\n\nIn addition, tipping or tilting SCP-019 will create a reaction as though it was previously \u201cfilled\u201d with SCP-019-2 specimens, although viewers looking into SCP-019 from above will merely observe a dark hole. Due to the production rates of SCP-019-2 when the object is disturbed, measurement of the internal cavity is difficult, but it is suspected to be inconsistent with outside measurements.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Document SCP-019-2-A \n\nSCP-019-2 notes, as maintained by Doctor Light and Doctor Vaux\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nSCP-019-2 specimen was removed from containment chamber and kept in reinforced pen, provided with water and live chickens as food. Specimen made quiet, continuous, garbled vocalizations, determined to be phonetically similar to Ancient Hellenic languages. Although the reason for this is unknown, specimens are still thought to be no more intelligent than animals.\n\n\n\nThe specimen lived for less than 48 hours, and a dissection revealed anatomy consistent on a cellular level with normal biology, but with an extremely unstable musculoskeletal structure. Other notable anomalies included an unstable respiratory system, nearly nonexistent digestive tract, and virtually no other internal organs. All other captured specimens have followed similar patterns of behavior and demise.\n\n\n\nNote: It appears that SCP-019-2 specimens were not intended to live for meaningful amounts of time outside of SCP-019. -Dr. Vaux\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nContainment unit was slightly damaged following prolonged exposure to SCP-019-2 specimen, missed by the monitoring team because of partial transparency. This has not been noted in SCP-019-2 before. Monitoring teams will continue to report further anomalies.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nMonitoring teams report some specimens of SCP-019-2 now appear to be significantly more resistant to incineration than others. It is hypothesized that this is a defense mechanism on the part of SCP-019.\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nMost specimens of SCP-019-2 are now all but entirely resistant to the effects of the incinerator. Replacement of incinerator with an acid bath is being considered. \u201cEvolution\u201d of SCP-019-2 is being studied, and may be evidence of sentience in SCP-019.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-018]]] | SCP-019 | [[[SCP-020]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> |author=Sophia Light]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Sphynx kittens.jpg\n\n> **Name:** File:Sphynx kittens.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Stephen Lea\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sphynx_kittens.jpg\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** scp-019-2-new.jpg\n\n> **Name:** File:Red-figure hydria with Poseidon, Amymone, Eros and Satyr (4th cent.

SCP-020 is only visible to humans when viewed through photographic or video surveillance.</p>\n<p>Once SCP-020 forms a colony, usually within a human residence, it will produce spores that affect the behavior of humans around it. Affected subjects will increase the heat and humidity within their homes to create an environment more suitable to the growth of SCP-020. Affected subjects also become more sociable in many cases, and often invite acquaintances to their homes to further spread the organism. As the spores and mold colonies are invisible to affected subjects, the mold may sometimes grow directly on living subjects.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"scp020-2.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-020/scp020-2.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>A civilian infected with SCP-020 colonies.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>As the spores and colonies within a home approach critical concentration, the health of affected human subjects will rapidly deteriorate, resulting in death.

It should be noted that the feeding process itself, beyond the sensation of movement, is painless; normal tattoo ink simply vanishes as it is 'eaten'.

However, due to the severe pain involved, this is less than ideal. Contact between two open wounds is generally preferable.

It is to remain locked at all times, with the sole exception being the appearance of an instance of SCP-022-1. The original door to SCP-022 was destroyed during Incident 022-827, with attempts at replacement being met with failure. Security cameras have been installed to monitor for instances of SCP-022-1.</p>\n<p>In the event that an instance of SCP-022-1 appears, automated systems should incinerate it the moment it leaves SCP-022. At this point the vault door may be unlocked to admit cleanup crews. Should the automated systems fail to destroy the instance of SCP-022-1, response teams are cleared to enter and neutralize it. Under no circumstances may any living human enter SCP-022 except at the order of Class-4 personnel for testing purposes. Class-4 personnel may also order instances of SCP-022-1 to be captured and held; however, they may not be removed from SCP-022 containment facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-022 is a morgue in the basement of [REDACTED] Hospital in Great Britain. Until 198\u2588, there were no reported anomalous occurrences within the morgue. Reports of strange activity were first received in November of 198\u2588. The area was soon quarantined by the Foundation, with an official story being released that the entire building had been condemned. The reason for the sudden manifestation of its strange properties remains under investigation.</p>\n<p>Periodically, a random drawer within the morgue will open to reveal a cadaver under a covered sheet. After approximately six minutes open, the cadaver will animate and attempt to leave the morgue. At this point, the cadaver is given the designation SCP-022-1. In some cases the cadaver will be too damaged or decomposed to successfully exit SCP-022 or even rise from the table it lies on. In this case, SCP-022-1 will typically struggle and twitch on the table until expiration occurs. Should an instance of SCP-022-1 expire while remaining on the table, the table slides back into the drawer, which then shuts. Reports indicate that the scent of burnt tissue is evident immediately following such an event.</p>\n<p>The energy source that sustains instances of SCP-022-1 is currently unknown. Instances do not breathe, eat, or sleep, and their bodies produce no heat. Analysis of SCP-022-1 following expiration has discovered no abnormal organs or chemicals present; they appear to be fully human cadavers.</p>\n<p>Instances also possess physical strength that exceeds that of normal humans. Though direct testing has proven problematic, researchers estimate the strength increase to be approximately 500\u00a0N (112\u00a0lb) of lifting force greater than what one would expect of a human body sharing a similar condition. Analysis is underway to determine if this effect is connected to the unknown power source or if it is an entirely separate phenomenon.</p>\n<p>When body parts are severed from SCP-022-1, the portion with the greatest mass retains its effects; all other pieces become inert. Destruction of the head or brain does not neutralize SCP-022-1; instead, the lower torso and limbs remain animate. Complete tissue destruction appears to be the only method of successfully terminating instances of SCP-022-1. Left alone, instances of SCP-022-1 will simply expire; all motion ceases and they appear to become normal cadavers again. The amount of time this takes depends on how damaged the body is and the rate of decomposition, and can take anywhere between two days and three weeks.</p>\n<p>Investigation has revealed that the bodies acting as SCP-022-1 match the description of cadavers reported to have been stolen from morgues across the country. The mechanism for this transfer is currently being researched.</p>\n<p>Adding any new matter to SCP-022 has thus far proved impossible.

    "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=SCP-022.png|caption=Image of SCP-022 through security camera.|width=350px]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-022\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A vault door has been installed following Incident 022-827 to seal SCP-022. It is to remain locked at all times, with the sole exception being the appearance of an instance of SCP-022-1. The original door to SCP-022 was destroyed during Incident 022-827, with attempts at replacement being met with failure. Security cameras have been installed to monitor for instances of SCP-022-1. \n\n\n\nIn the event that an instance of SCP-022-1 appears, automated systems should incinerate it the moment it leaves SCP-022. At this point the vault door may be unlocked to admit cleanup crews. Should the automated systems fail to destroy the instance of SCP-022-1, response teams are cleared to enter and neutralize it. Under no circumstances may any living human enter SCP-022 except at the order of Class-4 personnel for testing purposes. Class-4 personnel may also order instances of SCP-022-1 to be captured and held; however, they may not be removed from SCP-022 containment facilities.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-022 is a morgue in the basement of [REDACTED] Hospital in Great Britain. Until 198\u2588, there were no reported anomalous occurrences within the morgue. Reports of strange activity were first received in November of 198\u2588. The area was soon quarantined by the Foundation, with an official story being released that the entire building had been condemned. The reason for the sudden manifestation of its strange properties remains under investigation.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, a random drawer within the morgue will open to reveal a cadaver under a covered sheet. After approximately six minutes open, the cadaver will animate and attempt to leave the morgue. At this point, the cadaver is given the designation SCP-022-1. In some cases the cadaver will be too damaged or decomposed to successfully exit SCP-022 or even rise from the table it lies on. In this case, SCP-022-1 will typically struggle and twitch on the table until expiration occurs. Should an instance of SCP-022-1 expire while remaining on the table, the table slides back into the drawer, which then shuts. Reports indicate that the scent of burnt tissue is evident immediately following such an event. \n\n\n\nThe energy source that sustains instances of SCP-022-1 is currently unknown. Instances do not breathe, eat, or sleep, and their bodies produce no heat. Analysis of SCP-022-1 following expiration has discovered no abnormal organs or chemicals present; they appear to be fully human cadavers. \n\n\n\nInstances also possess physical strength that exceeds that of normal humans. Though direct testing has proven problematic, researchers estimate the strength increase to be approximately 500 N (112 lb) of lifting force greater than what one would expect of a human body sharing a similar condition. Analysis is underway to determine if this effect is connected to the unknown power source or if it is an entirely separate phenomenon. \n\n\n\nWhen body parts are severed from SCP-022-1, the portion with the greatest mass retains its effects; all other pieces become inert. Destruction of the head or brain does not neutralize SCP-022-1; instead, the lower torso and limbs remain animate. Complete tissue destruction appears to be the only method of successfully terminating instances of SCP-022-1. Left alone, instances of SCP-022-1 will simply expire; all motion ceases and they appear to become normal cadavers again. The amount of time this takes depends on how damaged the body is and the rate of decomposition, and can take anywhere between two days and three weeks.\n\n\n\nInvestigation has revealed that the bodies acting as SCP-022-1 match the description of cadavers reported to have been stolen from morgues across the country. The mechanism for this transfer is currently being researched. \n\n\n\nAdding any new matter to SCP-022 has thus far proved impossible. Any object that enters SCP-022 disappears shortly after passing through the door, leaving no trace. This includes inanimate objects and biological specimens. **See Addendum 022-001 and 022-002**.\n\n\n\nSo long as an instance of SCP-022-1 possesses a functioning mouth, tongue, and trachea, it is able to communicate fully with researchers. See [[[Interview Log 022-751]]] for details.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Addendum 022-001:** A request has been submitted to create a new entrance to SCP-022 by removing a portion of the South wall. Request pending approval. \n\n\n\n**Addendum 022-002:** A pile of matter was discovered on the floor of the room directly above SCP-022. It appeared to contain all matter that had been sent into SCP-022, with the exception of humans. All materials appeared broken and worn down. Metallic components were covered in large amounts of rust, with all biological parts being in various stages of decomposition. Testing revealed that the time between inserting an object into SCP-022 and it reappearing above to be precisely 183 seconds. Humans who enter, however, do not appear in said pile. Instead, humans appear to become integrated into the morgue, and may later animate as instances of SCP-022-1.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-021]]] | SCP-022 | [[[SCP-023]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-022.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user s d locke]]\n\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-022 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> ----\n\n> **Name:** MORTUARY\n\n> **Author:** Unknown Author\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [http://publicdomainq.net/body-morgue-0036302 Public Domain Q]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

To conceal its location, five (5) identical-looking replicas have been erected around SCP-024. A tight security perimeter must be maintained around SCP-024's compound at all times, with separate security teams guarding SCP-024 and its replicas. None of the security teams, except for team leaders, will be informed of the location of SCP-024. SCP-024 must be secured with magnetically sealed blast doors and reinforced, armored walls to prevent unauthorized entry.</p>\n<p>Under no circumstances can any security or research personnel enter SCP-024. Only D-Class personnel are allowed entry and strictly for research purposes only. All researchers are to observe and experiment with SCP-024 from the remote observation lab. Any personnel attempting to leave the remote observation lab or enter SCP-024 without prior approval from a Level 4 researcher must be immediately apprehended, with termination authorized.</p>\n<p>Should containment be breached, or SCP-024's true nature compromised, then the entire compound must be destroyed via specialized demolition charges planted throughout the compound.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-024 is an abandoned sound stage that was once owned by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. However, SCP-024 itself had been abandoned since 19\u2588\u2588, and it is unknown whether its special properties manifested before or after its abandonment. SCP-024 is located in the heart of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and was initially discovered when a group of teenage youths broke into the abandoned compound. The testimony of the lone \"winner\" when she turned herself in to the police was enough to have Foundation assets mobilize to contain SCP-024.</p>\n<p>Upon entering SCP-024, visitors are immediately greeted by an anonymous announcer, who communicates via intercom and is able to hear and comprehend the voices of people within SCP-024. The announcer will inform the \"contestants\" that they are about to take part in a game show in which the winners will win fabulous prizes, but will also warn that the game will be extremely hazardous, and that the losers will never leave SCP-024. It is at this point the announcer presents the choice of whether to stay or leave SCP-024. Contestants who accept will continue to participate in the game while those who decline are immediately expelled from SCP-024. Contestants that win the game or decline to participate may never enter SCP-024 again, as entry is denied by an impenetrable, invisible barrier.</p>\n<p>It is then that the contestants are led to the actual game. The style, composition, and appearance of the game always changes in every individual play-through, but the game is always centered around a long, elaborate obstacle course that the contestants must navigate through. The rules also vary. Some play-throughs may only allow a single winner, while others encourage the creation of teams to win the game. More often than not, the obstacles seen in these games range from incredibly benign to extremely hazardous and life-threatening. As the contestants attempt to negotiate the course, the announcer will continuously update their status and actively participate in the game, often giving advice, conversing with contestants, and adding new rules. As the game progresses, the obstacles become significantly more dangerous and difficult to overcome, and it is not surprising to have the entire pool of contestants succumb to the rigors of the obstacle course. If such an event happens, the announcer will express sadness at the lack of a winner and SCP-024 will shut down, resetting only when a new batch of contestants enter.</p>\n<p>Any attempts to \"break the rules\", such as assaulting other contestants and deliberately bypassing obstacles, are met by extreme violence. The announcer will call out the offending contestant, who will be quickly and forcefully ejected from the course by \"studio guardians\". These studio guardians will immediately materialize within SCP-024 when called upon by the announcer and disappear when not needed. The contestant will never be seen again.</p>\n<p>When a winner is declared, he/she will receive a random grand prize. Any contestants that have survived the course but failed to win are immediately declared losers by the announcer. The lights will switch off, and the winner will immediately appear outside of SCP-024 with his/her prize while the losers completely disappear.</p>\n<p>However, the most mysterious aspect of SCP-024 is that after every game, a VHS tape or DVD will appear in the mailbox outside of SCP-024's main entrance. This recording is a complete record of the entire game that was previously played, even though winners have claimed that they had never seen any cameras or recording devices inside SCP-024. Also, more strangely, a live studio audience can be seen in the background cheering on the contestants. Again, winners have claimed not to have seen a live studio audience while inside SCP-024.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> So far, the list of prizes awarded to winners has included, but is not limited to: cash prizes, electronics, various consumer goods, cars, collectibles, full-paid vacations to various countries, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Close examination of these prizes have confirmed that they are completely genuine, and possess no unusual abilities or characteristics whatsoever. There appears to be no consistent pattern for what the prizes will be.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> In an attempt to track where the \"losers\" are taken, GPS locator beacons were planted on subjects D-124 through D-135 when Group D245 was sent into SCP-024. When the losers were taken away, all signals from the beacons were lost. Whether this is because the beacons were destroyed, or because the losers were taken to an area that cannot be located via GPS is currently unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> The announcer living within SCP-024 appears to be sentient and aware of events that take place outside of the compound. During the test of Group D523, which consisted only of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the announcer instead engaged in a conversation with Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Analysis of the conversations have shown that the majority of the subjects are centered around pop culture and information distributed through television, implying that SCP-024 somehow is able to access and interpret television signals. Cutting all power and signal lines, as well as removing any potential wireless receiving equipment on SCP-024, does not affect SCP-024 in any way. When it became clear that no other contestants would participate, the announcer kindly asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to leave SCP-024 and suggested he return with more contestants.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 4:</strong> The studio guardians that the announcer uses to enforce the rules vary in appearance every game, just like the course. If they appear, the guardians will always be dressed in a manner that matches with the theme of the obstacle course. The only common attributes all guardians share are the possession of humanoid appearance, ability to suddenly appear and disappear, superhuman strength, and face concealing masks or headgear. However, winners have claimed that the guardians have no apparent shape or form inside SCP-024, instead appearing as huge, shadowy figures that engulf the offender.</p>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/scp-024\">SCP-024</a>\" by SpoonOfEvil, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Again, winners have claimed not to have seen a live studio audience while inside SCP-024. \n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** So far, the list of prizes awarded to winners has included, but is not limited to: cash prizes, electronics, various consumer goods, cars, collectibles, full-paid vacations to various countries, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Close examination of these prizes have confirmed that they are completely genuine, and possess no unusual abilities or characteristics whatsoever. There appears to be no consistent pattern for what the prizes will be.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:** In an attempt to track where the \"losers\" are taken, GPS locator beacons were planted on subjects D-124 through D-135 when Group D245 was sent into SCP-024. When the losers were taken away, all signals from the beacons were lost. Whether this is because the beacons were destroyed, or because the losers were taken to an area that cannot be located via GPS is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3:** The announcer living within SCP-024 appears to be sentient and aware of events that take place outside of the compound. During the test of Group D523, which consisted only of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the announcer instead engaged in a conversation with Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Analysis of the conversations have shown that the majority of the subjects are centered around pop culture and information distributed through television, implying that SCP-024 somehow is able to access and interpret television signals. Cutting all power and signal lines, as well as removing any potential wireless receiving equipment on SCP-024, does not affect SCP-024 in any way. When it became clear that no other contestants would participate, the announcer kindly asked Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to leave SCP-024 and suggested he return with more contestants.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4:** The studio guardians that the announcer uses to enforce the rules vary in appearance every game, just like the course. If they appear, the guardians will always be dressed in a manner that matches with the theme of the obstacle course. The only common attributes all guardians share are the possession of humanoid appearance, ability to suddenly appear and disappear, superhuman strength, and face concealing masks or headgear. However, winners have claimed that the guardians have no apparent shape or form inside SCP-024, instead appearing as huge, shadowy figures that engulf the offender.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-023]]] | SCP-024 | [[[SCP-025]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 024.jpg\n\n> **Name:** View Over Universal Studios Backlot\n\n> **Author:** Rob Young\n\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:view_Over_Universal_Studios_Backlot_(2562140962).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

Entry codes are to be given only to authorized research and security personnel. No other containment protocols required.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-025 is a wooden wardrobe measuring 0.97\u00a0m x 0.62\u00a0m x 1.95\u00a0m, full of clothing dating from a number of time periods. Articles contained within the chest, collectively named SCP-025-1, match with styles of decades from the 1920s to the present. The apparel from each time frame varies with regard to style; for example, a polyester striped shirt and pair of charcoal suit pants both correspond with general styles of the 1970s. The only unifying aspect of every article contained in SCP-025 is that each one is in poor condition; moths have eaten at much of the collection, and tears and runs are not uncommon.</p>\n<p>When any item from SCP-025 is put on, the wearer is observed either to die or suffer an injury within 24 hours. The cause of death or injury in these instances is invariably linked to the aforementioned flaws in the clothing, but only ever appears to be an unrelated incident. Wearing a glove with a fingertip cut off may result in the loss of the fingertip through a simple kitchen accident like chopping onions; similarly, a subject wearing a poncho with a sleeve missing will somehow cause the loss of the uncovered arm, be it an attack by a wild animal or a vehicular accident that necessitates the amputation of the limb. If placed in a sealed, unfurnished enclosure while wearing an item from the chest, the wearer will either seemingly spontaneously contract a flesh-eating disease that begins in the areas not covered by the clothing, or suffer the failure of an organ located beneath an imperfection in the article. Diseases arising from such incidents may or may not be contagious; no study has been successfully undertaken due to the speed at which the strains observed run their course. Recommended that, if possible, samples of the disease be taken to lab for possible weaponization.</p>\n<p>Following is an abridged testing log of SCP-025; more thorough testing will accompany the declassification of the document in its entirety.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">TEST LOG SCP-025, SECTION 1</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> D-778, a 42-year-old white male<br/>\n<strong>ARTICLE:</strong> 1940s-era white tuxedo<br/>\n<strong>IMPERFECTION(S):</strong> Torn seam in left shoulder<br/>\n<strong>TEST RESULTS:</strong> Subject was allowed free roam of the halls, under Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's supervision. For approximately 45 minutes, nothing eventful occurred; however, at \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588, security tapes and eyewitnesses indicate that D-778 appeared to make an attempt at attacking Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. He in turn overcame the subject with a knife, causing an inch-deep gash in D-778's left shoulder precisely at the point where the tuxedo's seam was ripped. Test halted; subject later terminated.</p>\n<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> D-690, a 26-year-old white male<br/>\n<strong>ARTICLE:</strong> 2004 Boston Red Sox baseball cap<br/>\n<strong>IMPERFECTION(S):</strong> Missing size adjuster in back of cap; logo in front partially removed<br/>\n<strong>TEST RESULTS:</strong> Placed in a sealed room with the subject was a table on which were a loaded Jericho \"Baby Eagle\" 9mm handgun, a grill lighter, and a hatchet. D-690 chose to wear the cap backward for the test; potential effects of this decision on the outcome of the test are unknown. Subject expressed reluctance to touch any of the objects on the table for several hours; food and water were provided as necessary. After four (4) hours of general inactivity, subject picked up the handgun and examined it; while holding it at roughly eye level, the weapon discharged into D-690's forehead, where the size adjustment band would have been. The round exited the subject near the part of the hat with the missing part of the logo.</p>\n<p><strong>SUBJECTS:</strong> D-736, a 22-year-old white male; D-771, a 23-year-old white male<br/>\n<strong>ARTICLE:</strong> Burgundy striped sweater vest, dating from 1973<br/>\n<strong>IMPERFECTION(S):</strong> Article seemed to have been partially eaten by moths; several large holes in the front of the sweater<br/>\n<strong>TEST RESULTS:</strong> D-736 was asked by researching staff to wear the sweater vest, which he did under duress. D-771 was given a loaded handgun out of sight of the other test participant and instructed to, on a given signal, fire all six (6) shots in the direction of D-736. After doing so, it was noted that every shot fired passed through one of the holes in the sweater vest, leaving the clothing intact and killing D-736. Firearm retrieved; surviving subject transported back to quarters.</p>\n<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> D-771, a 23-year-old white male<br/>\n<strong>ARTICLE:</strong> Sweater vest from above trial<br/>\n<strong>IMPERFECTION(S):</strong> Same as mentioned<br/>\n<strong>TEST RESULTS:</strong> D-771 was this time placed in an empty room, dimensions 15\u00a0m x 15\u00a0m x 15\u00a0m; only objects in the enclosure were lights overhead. Subject initially complained of boredom, then lay on his back and went to sleep. After 2 hours and 14 minutes, two (2) of the fluorescent light tubes in the ceiling suddenly dislodged and fell. Both landed squarely on holes in the sweater, shattering upon impact; one (1) of the tubes broke into jagged pieces that impaled D-771 in several areas, but only again through gaps already present in the sweater vest. Subject's vitals persisted for another six (6) minutes, then ceased. Further testing locations will be selected to minimize possible damage to the surrounding area.</p>\n<p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 [Unplanned experiment; an unidentified individual left an article from SCP-025 on Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's desk that looked similar to an item of his own clothing. Any information about this incident and/or the perpetrator of same should be reported immediately to senior staff.]<br/>\n<strong>ARTICLE:</strong> Lightweight scarf, dyed a number of colors<br/>\n<strong>IMPERFECTION(S):</strong> Heavily pulled seam caused scarf to be considerably shorter and tighter in the middle.<br/>\n<strong>TEST RESULTS:</strong> According to his itinerary, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, wearing the item from SCP-025, was en route to the enclosure of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for routine testing. However, he diverged from his intended path and began in a direction towards an entirely separate wing of the facility. Subject then entered the enclosure of <a href=\"/scp-173\">SCP-173</a> without gathering accompaniment or following safety procedures, and, upon hearing the door closing, blinked.

Entry codes are to be given only to authorized research and security personnel. No other containment protocols required.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-025 is a wooden wardrobe measuring 0.97 m x 0.62 m x 1.95 m, full of clothing dating from a number of time periods. Articles contained within the chest, collectively named SCP-025-1, match with styles of decades from the 1920s to the present. The apparel from each time frame varies with regard to style; for example, a polyester striped shirt and pair of charcoal suit pants both correspond with general styles of the 1970s. The only unifying aspect of every article contained in SCP-025 is that each one is in poor condition; moths have eaten at much of the collection, and tears and runs are not uncommon.\n\n\n\nWhen any item from SCP-025 is put on, the wearer is observed either to die or suffer an injury within 24 hours. The cause of death or injury in these instances is invariably linked to the aforementioned flaws in the clothing, but only ever appears to be an unrelated incident. Wearing a glove with a fingertip cut off may result in the loss of the fingertip through a simple kitchen accident like chopping onions; similarly, a subject wearing a poncho with a sleeve missing will somehow cause the loss of the uncovered arm, be it an attack by a wild animal or a vehicular accident that necessitates the amputation of the limb. If placed in a sealed, unfurnished enclosure while wearing an item from the chest, the wearer will either seemingly spontaneously contract a flesh-eating disease that begins in the areas not covered by the clothing, or suffer the failure of an organ located beneath an imperfection in the article. Diseases arising from such incidents may or may not be contagious; no study has been successfully undertaken due to the speed at which the strains observed run their course. Recommended that, if possible, samples of the disease be taken to lab for possible weaponization.\n\n\n\nFollowing is an abridged testing log of SCP-025; more thorough testing will accompany the declassification of the document in its entirety.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> **__TEST LOG SCP-025, SECTION 1__**\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> **SUBJECT:** D-778, a 42-year-old white male\n\n> **ARTICLE:** 1940s-era white tuxedo\n\n> **IMPERFECTION(S):** Torn seam in left shoulder\n\n> **TEST RESULTS:** Subject was allowed free roam of the halls, under Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's supervision. For approximately 45 minutes, nothing eventful occurred; however, at \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588, security tapes and eyewitnesses indicate that D-778 appeared to make an attempt at attacking Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. He in turn overcame the subject with a knife, causing an inch-deep gash in D-778's left shoulder precisely at the point where the tuxedo's seam was ripped. Test halted; subject later terminated.\n\n> \n\n> **SUBJECT:** D-690, a 26-year-old white male\n\n> **ARTICLE:** 2004 Boston Red Sox baseball cap\n\n> **IMPERFECTION(S):** Missing size adjuster in back of cap; logo in front partially removed\n\n> **TEST RESULTS:** Placed in a sealed room with the subject was a table on which were a loaded Jericho \"Baby Eagle\" 9mm handgun, a grill lighter, and a hatchet. D-690 chose to wear the cap backward for the test; potential effects of this decision on the outcome of the test are unknown. Subject expressed reluctance to touch any of the objects on the table for several hours; food and water were provided as necessary. After four (4) hours of general inactivity, subject picked up the handgun and examined it; while holding it at roughly eye level, the weapon discharged into D-690's forehead, where the size adjustment band would have been. The round exited the subject near the part of the hat with the missing part of the logo.\n\n> \n\n> **SUBJECTS:** D-736, a 22-year-old white male; D-771, a 23-year-old white male\n\n> **ARTICLE:** Burgundy striped sweater vest, dating from 1973\n\n> **IMPERFECTION(S):** Article seemed to have been partially eaten by moths; several large holes in the front of the sweater\n\n> **TEST RESULTS:** D-736 was asked by researching staff to wear the sweater vest, which he did under duress. D-771 was given a loaded handgun out of sight of the other test participant and instructed to, on a given signal, fire all six (6) shots in the direction of D-736. After doing so, it was noted that every shot fired passed through one of the holes in the sweater vest, leaving the clothing intact and killing D-736. Firearm retrieved; surviving subject transported back to quarters.\n\n> \n\n> **SUBJECT:** D-771, a 23-year-old white male\n\n> **ARTICLE:** Sweater vest from above trial\n\n> **IMPERFECTION(S):** Same as mentioned\n\n> **TEST RESULTS:** D-771 was this time placed in an empty room, dimensions 15 m x 15 m x 15 m; only objects in the enclosure were lights overhead. Subject initially complained of boredom, then lay on his back and went to sleep. After 2 hours and 14 minutes, two (2) of the fluorescent light tubes in the ceiling suddenly dislodged and fell. Both landed squarely on holes in the sweater, shattering upon impact; one (1) of the tubes broke into jagged pieces that impaled D-771 in several areas, but only again through gaps already present in the sweater vest. Subject's vitals persisted for another six (6) minutes, then ceased. Further testing locations will be selected to minimize possible damage to the surrounding area.\n\n> \n\n> **SUBJECT:** Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 [Unplanned experiment; an unidentified individual left an article from SCP-025 on Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's desk that looked similar to an item of his own clothing. Any information about this incident and/or the perpetrator of same should be reported immediately to senior staff.]\n\n> **ARTICLE:** Lightweight scarf, dyed a number of colors\n\n> **IMPERFECTION(S):** Heavily pulled seam caused scarf to be considerably shorter and tighter in the middle.\n\n> **TEST RESULTS:** According to his itinerary, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, wearing the item from SCP-025, was en route to the enclosure of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for routine testing. However, he diverged from his intended path and began in a direction towards an entirely separate wing of the facility. Subject then entered the enclosure of [[[SCP-173]]] without gathering accompaniment or following safety procedures, and, upon hearing the door closing, blinked. Cause of death listed as strangulation resulting from a crushed windpipe.\n\n> \n\n> **SUBJECT:** D-802, a 30-year-old Hispanic female\n\n> **ARTICLE:** 1980s //Flashdance//-style white shirt\n\n> **IMPERFECTION(S):** Right shoulder removed, left sleeve completely cut off, entire bottom hem shredded\n\n> **TEST RESULTS:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. All present were presumed infected, then quarantined and [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n> All further tests involving 1980s-era fashion have been postponed indefinitely due to the expenditures and safety hazards presented by the aforementioned experiment. Full cleanup estimated to take an additional \u2588\u2588 weeks.\n\n\n\nFurther testing authorized; results now awaiting declassification.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-024]]] | SCP-025 | [[[SCP-026]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 025.jpeg\n\n> **Name:** Wall Cabinet Wardrobe Wood Red Brown Black Furniture Setup\n\n> **Author:** Unknown Author\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1093565 PxHere]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n",

All creatures removed from the Subject's containment cell are to be incinerated, except for a small portion to be diverted for analysis and necropsy. The cell is to be cleaned and inspected for structural damage daily.</p>\n<p>Subject 027-02 must be monitored by at least two personnel at all times. Any unusual behavior or vital signs on the part of the subject or the appearance of any unusual species in the subject\u2019s vicinity must immediately be reported to Level 4 personnel.</p>\n<p>Security personnel assigned to SCP-027 must be inoculated against all known animal-borne pathogens and must be armed with tranquilizer guns, with standing orders to subdue the subject if the need arises.</p>\n<p>Until SCP-027 is better understood, no personnel of Level 4 Clearance or higher should approach within 200\u00a0m of the Subject.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-027 appears to be a phenomenon of unknown source that seems to be tied to one human subject (currently 027-02) at a time. As host to SCP-027, subject 027-02 is constantly surrounded by swarming vermin that are drawn to his location. The subject does not appear able to assert control over these creatures in any way, and is in fact prone to occasional attacks from feral specimens. These creatures have also been known to attack personnel who approach too closely.</p>\n<p>Wherever the subject goes, an initial swarm of flying insects such as gnats and flies will start to form a cloud around him, usually within two to three minutes. Shortly thereafter, crawling animals (including lice, cockroaches, worms, spiders, [DATA EXPUNGED], mice, and rats) will begin to appear; the longer the subject remains in a location, the more vermin will gather there. When the subject leaves a location, some of these creatures will follow, but most will disperse.</p>\n<p>SCP-027 has been known to transfer between hosts once, upon the death of the first known host, Subject 027-01 (see Appendix 1 for more information). Since SCP-027 could likely repeat this feat upon the death of Subject 027-02, all high-value personnel should be kept far away from the current host until more about SCP-027 is understood. SCP-027 has also likely transferred between hosts an unknown number of times before containment. Research into potential previous hosts has commenced, with preliminary evidence suggesting that SCP-027 may have existed for at least \u2588\u2588\u2588 years.</p>\n<p>It is not yet known how SCP-027 chooses or attracts animals, or even what SCP-027 exactly is. The previous host never expressed having any sort of communication with a separate conscious entity; analysis of the current host has been inconclusive at best.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Appendix 1:</strong> Timeline of Significant Events</p>\n<p>04/\u2588\u2588/199\u2588: Subject 027-01 is discovered in an abandoned warehouse outside \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588, that had been completely overrun by rats, cockroaches, and other vermin, and is contained and cataloged as SCP-027. The subject is described as a Caucasian male in his late thirties, of average height but gaunt, filthy, and covered in bites and scratches. The subject also shows symptoms of degraded mental health, evidence of heavy use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and signs of prolonged sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p>10/\u2588\u2588/200\u2588: Subject expires.

Currently, SCP-028 is contained on site (Site \u2588), as SCP-028 is not transportable by any known means. SCP-028 is sealed in a six (6) by six (6) by three (3) meter (twenty (20) by twenty (20) by ten (10) foot) concrete room with a single door, with two (2) armed personnel stationed outside. Only authorized personnel are to be allowed exposure to SCP-028, and extreme care must be taken at all times. While SCP-028 is itself harmless, the effect can be very damaging to the unprepared. (See document EL-028-1125)</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-028 is located in an abandoned storage yard outside a copper mine in northern Michigan. SCP-028 has no detectable physical presence of any kind, but its effect occurs in a 2.1 meter (7 foot) cube around what is commonly held as the \u201ccenter\u201d of SCP-028. All forms of scanning and testing in the area of SCP-028 have shown no abnormal readings. Adding or removing objects, or attempting to remove dirt from under SCP-028 has no effect in altering the size or shape of SCP-028\u2019s area of effect, nor the onset or quality of the Effect.</p>\n<p>Subjects \u201centering\u201d SCP-028 are, within three (3) to six (6) seconds, struck by total and complete knowledge of a subject. This knowledge is thus far completely random in both size and usefulness, and sometimes goes unnoticed for extended periods of time. More \u201cprofound\u201d knowledge generally has a stronger effect, with some cases [EXPUNGED: SEE DOCUMENT EL-028-1125]. This Effect can be experienced multiple times by exiting and re-entering SCP-028, but can result in increasingly strong migraines and dizziness after two (2) exposures.</p>\n<p>SCP-028 came to the Foundation\u2019s attention after research into news reports of a local miner who submitted a design for a cold-fusion reactor to the US patent office. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that it \u201cjust came to me, like a bolt outta the blue!\u201d News and subjects were suppressed and contained after discovery of SCP-028, and the reactor designs implemented in the containment of <a href=\"/scp-1995\">SCP-1995</a>. Subsequent testing of SCP-028 has yielded mixed results.</p>\n<p><strong>Document #EL-028-1114:</strong> Partial Information Retrieval Log for 1/5/\u2588\u2588 (Note: all knowledge is perfect, total, and eidetic)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every phonebook entry for New York City in 1998</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>How to redesign the internal combustion engine to run on human blood, using only pre-existing parts.

Currently, SCP-028 is contained on site (Site \u2588), as SCP-028 is not transportable by any known means. SCP-028 is sealed in a six (6) by six (6) by three (3) meter (twenty (20) by twenty (20) by ten (10) foot) concrete room with a single door, with two (2) armed personnel stationed outside. Only authorized personnel are to be allowed exposure to SCP-028, and extreme care must be taken at all times. While SCP-028 is itself harmless, the effect can be very damaging to the unprepared. (See document EL-028-1125)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-028 is located in an abandoned storage yard outside a copper mine in northern Michigan. SCP-028 has no detectable physical presence of any kind, but its effect occurs in a 2.1 meter (7 foot) cube around what is commonly held as the \u201ccenter\u201d of SCP-028. All forms of scanning and testing in the area of SCP-028 have shown no abnormal readings. Adding or removing objects, or attempting to remove dirt from under SCP-028 has no effect in altering the size or shape of SCP-028\u2019s area of effect, nor the onset or quality of the Effect.\n\n\n\nSubjects \u201centering\u201d SCP-028 are, within three (3) to six (6) seconds, struck by total and complete knowledge of a subject. This knowledge is thus far completely random in both size and usefulness, and sometimes goes unnoticed for extended periods of time. More \u201cprofound\u201d knowledge generally has a stronger effect, with some cases [EXPUNGED: SEE DOCUMENT EL-028-1125]. This Effect can be experienced multiple times by exiting and re-entering SCP-028, but can result in increasingly strong migraines and dizziness after two (2) exposures.\n\n\n\nSCP-028 came to the Foundation\u2019s attention after research into news reports of a local miner who submitted a design for a cold-fusion reactor to the US patent office. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that it \u201cjust came to me, like a bolt outta the blue!\u201d News and subjects were suppressed and contained after discovery of SCP-028, and the reactor designs implemented in the containment of [[[SCP-1995]]]. Subsequent testing of SCP-028 has yielded mixed results.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Document #EL-028-1114:** Partial Information Retrieval Log for 1/5/\u2588\u2588 (Note: all knowledge is perfect, total, and eidetic)\n\n\n\n* Every phonebook entry for New York City in 1998\n\n\n\n* How to redesign the internal combustion engine to run on human blood, using only pre-existing parts. (Note: Full redesign takes four (4) hours, and runs at higher efficiency than gasoline.)\n\n\n\n* Location of keys for a Buick LeSabre\n\n\n\n* The proper method of care for a mole rat colony\n\n\n\n* Origin and history of twelve SCP objects. (Note: The main [EXPUNGED])\n\n\n\n* Family history of the Blackthorn family, located in London, England.\n\n\n\n* Geological structure of the earth beneath Greenland, including several unknown caves and [EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n**Document # EL-028-1125:** Log\n\n\n\n**E-112:** Subject D-1182 exposed to SCP-028. Subject began to cry and went into fetal position, showing signs of high distress. Unresponsive to questioning and outside stimulus for several days. Lapsed into catatonia shortly after stating that \u201cthis is not life\u201d. Subject passed into a coma and died shortly thereafter. C.O.D. was attributed to shock.\n\n\n\n**E-127:** Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 accidentally exposed to SCP-028. Agent showed signs of sudden surprise and bemusement. When questioned, Agent requested \u201ca moment to gather my thoughts, please\u201d. After several seconds, Agent laughed, shook his head, and removed his service pistol from its holster. Agent then shot and wounded Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and killed Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, before being restrained.

Both of these extra human abilities are greatly hampered in the presences of bright or direct light, natural or artificial. In addition, any males who come within the presence of SCP-029, an area defined by her current perception, find themselves pliant to her will.

Interviews with SCP-029 have proven difficult to conduct, due to SCP-029's constant attempts to kill or convert all who speak with her. Over her years of captivity, the black patches on her skin have increased in size.</p>\n<p>SCP-029 was first brought to the Foundation's attention by an Agent working in rural India. An attempt on his life led him to a small cult of men who claimed to be 'Thuggees,' in service to the Daughter. Several weeks of investigation proved that they believed the world to be in the last years of the 'Kali Yuga,' and that by sacrificing one million lives to the Daughter of Darkness, they could raise their Goddess and end the world.

When questioned about it, she claimed her 'followers were on the move once more.' Investigation led us to a concentration of so-called 'Thuggees' that had escaped our initial foray. After discovering that all her followers were there for one of their holy days, a tactical air strike was called in. When the first bomb dropped, SCP-029 awoke from slumber, screaming at the top of her lungs.

Minor adaptations to accommodate its stature, such as an appropriately-scaled workspace and chair, are to be included. Lighting within the cell may be altered upon request of SCP-030 to a maximum of 2000 lumens via a simple dimmer switch. Should the need to render SCP-030 inert arise, staff may extinguish the lighting from the exterior switch and draw blackout curtains as necessary. Standard night-vision equipment is available for observation of SCP-030 in its inert state.</p>\n<p>SCP-030 may request materials for personal research every 90 days. All previously requested materials are to be collected and destroyed prior to delivery of new materials. All materials are to be evaluated and screened by both research and security staff. SCP-030 is to be denied access to any modern scientific journals or texts, and fiction is to be restricted to works produced no later than 1623 CE to preserve the integrity of its innate knowledge.</p>\n<p>Staff wishing to consult with SCP-030 in writing are to place a formal request (document #030-RS/B) with the supervising researcher on duty. All correspondence is to be retained. Staff wishing to consult with SCP-030 in person are to submit a formal request to site management (documents 030-RP/A, 17-030/A) at least 30 days prior to their preferred consultation date. All consultations are to be recorded and retained. Senior research staff may request SCP-030 be temporarily removed from its containment for a maximum of one hour to provide observational insight into non-restricted materials or events within Site-17. Under no circumstances is SCP-030 to leave the confines of Site-17. Requests must be presented in person to site management and security staff at least 30 days prior to their preferred observational release date. All observational release events are to be recorded and retained. SCP-030 has been equipped with a tracking device (inventory control code #030-17-1) so its location within Site-17 may be determined precisely at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-030 appears as a hairless, genderless, grey-toned human 71 centimeters (28 inches) in height and weighing 12.70 kilograms (two British stone in antiquated measure). Its solid blue eyes lack discernible irises or pupils, and resemble small cut sapphires. SCP-030 possesses an androgynous voice with a pronounced English accent not currently identifiable as specific to any modern region. It is able to converse, read and write in Ancient Greek, Latin, Italian, English, Spanish and Portuguese as well as two (2) additional languages that have not yet been identified despite SCP-030's insistence that they should be \"common knowledge.\" SCP-030 has also demonstrated knowledge of physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics and horticulture roughly equivalent to that of a 17th-century CE academic. In addition, SCP-030 has demonstrated knowledge on these topics along research lines that do not appear in the historical record. These alternative or entirely unknown approaches to research in the natural sciences are one source of SCP-030's utility in consultation.</p>\n<p>SCP-030 remains active while a 15-lumen source of light or greater is within 1.5 meters (5 feet). In the absence of light, SCP-030 becomes inert, apparently losing consciousness and showing no outward signs of life. Within five to ten (5-10) seconds of being re-exposed to light, SCP-030 becomes active once more, appearing to come out of a light slumber no matter how long the period of inactivity has been. SCP-030 does not appear to require these periods of inactivity as a human would require sleep, and has expressed a desire to remain active as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Biopsy analysis of SCP-030 remains inconclusive. While clays native to the English counties of Kent, Surrey, and Greater London make up the majority of its structure, traces of mandrake (<em>Mandragora officinarum</em>), lye, mercury, and human blood have been found in each sample taken. SCP-030 has expressed that a full exploratory surgery to determine its workings would potentially end its existence. Samples removed from SCP-030 do not regenerate, and sampling is currently discontinued to preserve its integrity. Although SCP-030 can be damaged, it does not appear to feel pain, and will simply re-mold any portion of its anatomy that experiences deformation. Notably, SCP-030 cannot be molded directly by human hands, though any number of tools may be used to alter its surface. SCP-030 does not respirate, requires no sustenance, and produces no waste, although it does infrequently request a bath.</p>\n<p>SCP-030 refers to itself as \"Ariel\" and regularly requests that staff do the same. Questions regarding how SCP-030 was created and by whom are routinely answered with the seemingly rote statement: \"I have been asked to forget that bit of information. Terribly sorry.\" SCP-030 delivers this response in the same tone and cadence each time any question regarding its origins or creator are presented. Given its composition and location of origin, a link to the <a href=\"/finding-balance\">Alchemists</a> of <a href=\"/scp-2264\">Alagadda</a> is suspected.</p>\n<p>SCP-030 was discovered 6/12/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 during a mandatory archaeological survey within London's Mortlake District pending construction of a car park. It was buried approximately 2.7 meters (9 feet) below street level, contained in a small stone sarcophagus. The sarcophagus bore no markings and was assumed to be that of a deceased infant as additional graves were discovered in the survey area. The sarcophagus lid was shattered during the excavation, exposing SCP-030 to daylight. Upon being struck by the sun's rays, SCP-030 roused from its inert state to one of mild activity within a few seconds, stating, \"Good afternoon\" to the assembled construction team. A member of the Foundation's Greater London recon force was summoned within hours and took the specimen into custody without resistance. The limited number of witnesses were given amnestics and released.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Document\u00a0030-C:\u00a0Security\u00a0Logs\u00a0for\u00a0SCP-030</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide\u00a0Document\u00a0030-C:\u00a0Security\u00a0Logs\u00a0for\u00a0SCP-030</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>9/14/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Tracking system installed for SCP-030.</p>\n<p>12/21/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: SCP-030 reports malfunction of its own tracking system.
