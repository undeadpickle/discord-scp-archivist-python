Description: SCP-455 is a large cargo ship currently run aground on the southern coast of Chile. Most of its structure is underwater and badly damaged, with rust coating 85 to 90 percent of all surfaces. Internal structure appears to be significantly larger than external dimensions, and is not flooded despite large holes visible on outer hull.
Internal structure appears to be a random assembly of rooms, halls, and structures. Initial salvage teams reported rooms made of human teeth, an engine with tendon strips for timing belts, a hall extending for 182.88 m (600 ft) beyond where the outer hull should terminate, an open ""gym"" room with steel walls as pliant as taffy, and numerous audio and visual hallucinations. Team was lost after reporting entry to ""central navigation."" Rescue team lost after reporting the investigation of ""screaming"" in a cargo section.
Dr. ███████████████ has suggested the use of robots to map the interior of SCP-455 after the failure of several manned exploration teams.
Experiment Log 455 details the attempts to explore SCP-455 and information established despite their failures overall.
Exploration Log Record 455 3 - Record of last major exploration attempt by MTF Zeta-9.
