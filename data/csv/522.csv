Classified





SCP-829-A photographed the day after SCP-829.



Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-829-A and SCP-829-B are to be stored within a concrete-lined aircraft hangar at Site-327. SCP-829-B is not to be removed from its biohazard container so as to prevent any advanced polymer formation. Standard anti-contaminant quarantine procedures will apply to SCP-829-A and SCP-829-B's containment hangar. Only Level 3+ Personnel are allowed to access SCP-829-A and B.
Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor and replace any references to twenty-one Concordes having been created with the disseminated cover that only twenty were produced; the twenty-first (217/F-BVFG) will assume the identification and livery of SCP-829-A. All individuals involved with British Airways Flight 3075 are to be amnesticized of SCP-829 and the passengers of the flight.

Description:
SCP-829 is the designation for a temporal event that occurred during British Airways Flight 30751 on March 2nd, 1993. Details surrounding the SCP-829 event can be found in the Item History below.
SCP-829-A is a FA/BAC Concorde supersonic airliner (210/G-BOAD) that was the subject of SCP-829. It appears to be non-anomalous, but is considered to be anomalous by proxy in order to study SCP-829.
SCP-829-B is a viscous non-Newtonian fluid with a composition of water, amino acids, and other organic compounds. The method of 829-B's creation through polymer and DNA reduction is currently unknown.

Item History:
SCP-829 occurred at 1:21 PM GMT, seventeen minutes after takeoff. Immediately before the event, Speedbird 30752 notified Heathrow Air Traffic Control (H-ATC) that they would be flying on IFR due to low-to-no visibility; conflicting with weather reports that had come in greatly favoring VMC over IMC. H-ATC attempted to ascertain the state of Speedbird 3075, but all communication requests were unresponsive. Only the phrase ""Control, how do you hear me?"" was transmitted from Speedbird 3075 to H-ATC before the plane disappeared off of radar.
Speedbird 3075 (now SCP-829-A) re-appeared on radar at 11:53 AM EST. JFK Intl. Air Traffic Control (J-ATC) informed 829-A of radar contact and to go around3, but SCP-829-A did not respond and performed a landing on Runway 31L. J-ATC issued a temporary shutdown of Runway 31L following 829-A's non-compliance with further taxiing off of the runway. After visually identifying SCP-829-A from information forwarded by Heathrow, JFK Intl. contacted the Foundation under Rule 4, Subsection B of airport incident policy. Preliminary testing of SCP-829-A revealed that it was highly irradiated; after two days of hourly decontamination service, 829-A was deemed safe enough for MTF Δ-9 (""Baggage Claim"") to be inserted with full protection gear.
Any subsequent pertinent information will be appended as addenda once fully reviewed.

MTF OPERATION LOG



The following log was compiled during initial exploration of SCP-829-A by MTF Δ-9 (""Baggage Claim""). Due to the ionizing radiation, Foundation body cameras were inoperable; personnel were instructed to verbally describe the interior of SCP-829-A.
Personnel assigned to MTF Δ-9 at the time of the log's recording:

Researcher Pierre Miller
Researcher Aurey Standish
Researcher Neil Haldane





[MILLER]
Comms control, this is Miller. How do you read me?


[COMCON]
Loud and clear. You may proceed with the insertion process.


[MILLER]
We're on the tarmac, approaching the instance currently. Haldane, you'll be right behind with the equipment, correct?


[HALDANE]
Standish and I have got the canisters.


[MILLER]
Good.


[COMCON]
Delta-Nine, we see you taking the stair unit up. We will not be able to keep visual contact once you are inside the craft, do you understand?


[MILLER]
We understand, comms control.



There is a lengthy pause as Researcher Miller operates the door to SCP-829-A. The three researchers enter the airplane.


[STANDISH]
It's dark as hell in here.


[COMCON]
Could you be more specific, Standish?


[STANDISH]
Yes, when there's a lack of light in an area, it pr-


[MILLER]
Knock it off.


[STANDISH]
Sorry.


[MILLER]
He's correct though. There's poor visuals in here. We'll be using the auxiliary flashlights; turning them on now.



The click of the flashlight activation can be heard.


[HALDANE]
Jesus…


[STANDISH]
What the?



It is assumed at this time that the researchers make their way through the plane.


[COMCON]
Delta-Nine, what's going on? Are you alright?


[MILLER]
We're- we're fine.


[STANDISH]
Uh, control, how many passengers were on the flight?


[COMCON]
One-hundred and two.


[STANDISH]
Well. Shit.


[MILLER]
Comms control, we can only account for maybe a third of those passengers.


[COMCON]
Please advise?


[MILLER]
Most of the passengers we can see are still seated. They… appear to be sleeping, almost as if they're in a coma. No external injuries noted.


[HALDANE]
Unresponsive too. I attempted to wake one, even shined my flashlight in her eyes. Her pupils remained dilated.


[COMCON]
Understood. It's been logged. Anything else of note, Delta-Nine?


[STANDISH]
Who wants to tell them?


[MILLER]
I can.


[MILLER]
Comms control, the interior of the plane is coated in this thick, sludge-like substance.


[STANDISH]
It's very sticky — makes it hard to maneuver.


[MILLER]
It's of an orange-greenish color, but we don't know if the flashlight is affecting its visual appearance or not. Can we get a bio-collection team after we're finished to properly analyze the substance?


[COMCON]
They've been queued up, Delta-Nine. Please use your canisters to collect some of the material if possible.


[HALDANE]
On it.


[MILLER]
The substance is all throughout the plane, but appears to be… collected in locations where the passengers have been. It's, well, hrm —


[STANDISH]
Hey, stay sharp. I think we've got a live one!


[MILLER]
Comms did you hear?


[COMCON]
We heard.


[STANDISH]
Who was sitting in… seat 43B?


[COMCON]
Give us a second, Standish.



A voice is heard off of A. Standish's external mic.


[PASSENGER]
Where- where am I? Where are- hello? Hello?


[HALDANE]
Jesus, he's thrashing around like crazy.


[COMCON]
43B was sold to one William Oparin.


[MILLER]
Mr. Oparin? Can you hear us?


[STANDISH]
You forgot the speaker, Miller.


[MILLER]
Crap. You're right.


[MILLER]
Mr. Oparin? Can you hear us?


[OPARIN]
Who's there? Who are you? Where am I?


[MILLER]
Mr. Oparin, please calm down. I'm Pierre Miller, I'm with the British Airways medical team.


[OPARIN]
I- I can't see- you. It's bright… so bright… where am I?


[HALDANE]
Doesn't seem as worked up anymore.


[MILLER]
Mr. Oparin, you're still onboard your flight.


[OPARIN]
It's been so long. It called out to me, singing. I was due. The spark.


[MILLER]
Who? Can you tell me what you're seeing, Mr. Oparin?


[OPARIN]
It's bright. The sunlight brings forth a new term. I- I've been waiting so long. The sea… of us…


[HALDANE]
He's not here.


[STANDISH]
I think we should move him. Get him to one of our docs.


[MILLER]
You may be right, Standish. Comms control, can we-


[OPARIN]
Oparin starts screaming loudly.


[STANDISH]
Urgh!


[MILLER]
Mr. Oparin, please, I need you to calm down. Mr. Oparin?


[HALDANE]
I'm going to move him.


[MILLER]
Mr. Oparin!


[OPARIN]
It burns… the heat, the sky is red… the light… it's bright, oh, so bright, it's bright.


[HALDANE]
I'm- I'm stuck!


[MILLER]
Haldane?


[HALDANE]
Miller, Standish, help! I'm fucking stuck, my hands are fucking glued to him.


[STANDISH]
I can't separate them. Miller?


[MILLER]
I'm pulling!


[OPARIN]
My children. My progenitors. They were unwilling to accept their fated days…


[HALDANE]
Pull harder for fuck's sake! God, man, c'mon!


[MILLER]
It's not working. Standish, get the chemical remover, quick.


[OPARIN]
I don't! No. No. No! Help, someone help! I'm being pulled apaaaAAAAAAAAA—


[STANDISH]
I've got it!


[HALDANE]
He's liquefying! Goddammit, Standish, hurry up, he's liqu-



The feed from N. Haldane's mic cuts out.


[MILLER]
Haldane?


[STANDISH]
Haldane! Haldane?!



There is a pause.


[MILLER]
Comms control, uh.


[MILLER]
Haldane's gone.


[COMCON]
Repeat that?


[MILLER]
Haldane is gone. Him and Oparin turned into the… substance.


[STANDISH]
I'm sorry, Neil.



Silence.


[COMCON]
Delta-Nine. Get out of there as soon as possible. We're monitoring things and the Caulli levels in there are starting to spike.


[STANDISH]
Collected some of the material. Let's go.


[MILLER]
Yeah. Let's… yeah.











N. Haldane's mic re-activates.


[???]
I remain. I remain. Life..?


[???]
Standish… Miller…. Standish… Miller… Standish…


[???]
Where am I?



N. Haldane's mic cuts out again, permanently.








Addendum 02: FURTHER ANALYSIS ON SCP-829-B



« Carbon-14 Dating Test »

» Carbon-14 Dating Test «

Several radiocarbon dating tests of the SCP-829-B fluid taken directly from the Haldane and Oparin coalescence estimates it to be approximately 3.7 billion years old.
Continued testing of the anomaly is required.
