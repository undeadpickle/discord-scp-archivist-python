Addenda 194.A-194.C: Documentation of SCP-194-Z

Close

Addendum 194.A (Object Class): Euclid
Addendum 194.B (Special Containment Procedures): The object presently designated SCP-194 is contained in a concrete mausoleum located in a New Orleans cemetery, the location of which is included in attached file 194-LOC-A. The mausoleum is to be checked for damage or deterioration once every 30 days. Any reality-restructuring effects of SCP-194 which appear to impact the space outside of it should be reported to containment staff.
Due to the effects of SCP-194-Z upon the SCP-194 designation, the acting documentation of SCP-194-Z is presented in the form of various addenda to the acting SCP-194 designation. Any secondary classifications are to be assigned in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. SCP-194-Z), and all addenda are to be designated alphabetically, rather than numerically (i.e. Addendum 194.A). This is to prevent conflict with documentation applied to the SCP-194 designation.
Despite changes to the SCP-194 designation, Addenda 194.A through 194.C describe the true nature of SCP-194-Z, and will remain unaltered regardless of other edits.
Addendum 194.C (Description): SCP-194-Z refers to a phenomenon surrounding the SCP-194 designation. Various objects are assigned to the SCP-194 designation at various times, causing the SCP-194 file to be altered based on the affected object. Only one object can be assigned to the SCP-194 slot at any time, causing minor retroactive alterations to support the containment of each object in Foundation custody.
Notably, most affected objects assigned to the SCP-194 designation are non-anomalous in nature.

SUBJECT 1: Well I mean…I guess I thought—
SUBJECT 2: (Deep sigh) We are coworkers, Garth. I was under the impression this was going to be a friendly after-work chit-chat. And your texts—
