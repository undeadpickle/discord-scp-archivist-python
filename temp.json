As a result, Foundation efforts are to focus on the following:</p>\n<p>- Recovery of remaining motile civilians to Foundation-organized safe communities;</p>\n<p>- Restoration of Foundation technological and communications infrastructure wherever possible;</p>\n<p>- Restoration of the concept of "time" via reconstruction of SCP-001-1.</p>\n<p>Those affected by SCP-001 are currently considered lost. Preservation of the veil is to be disregarded.</p>\n<p>Foundation agents have the full approval of remaining O5 council members to eliminate persons or groups deemed hostile to the Foundation\'s mission with prejudice.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001 is categorized as a ZK-Class Temporal Cessation event, which resulted in the total cessation of the standard passage of time on February 13th, 2025 at 0710 PST. Following SCP-001, the natural progress of time as understood by society ceased. Affected persons, animals, inanimate objects, etc. remain locked in the position they were in when the event took place and are incapable of independent motion.</p>\n<p>While SCP-001 is believed to affect an overwhelming amount of the population, a currently unknown number of humans have remained unaffected. Unaffected individuals retain the ability to move and interact with their environment, however, most natural biological processes have ceased.</p>\n<p>The mechanics of SCP-001 are poorly understood beyond what is outlined above. Research remains ongoing.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-1 was a stone shrine dedicated to Aeternum<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference(\'footnote-1\')">1</a></sup> located within Olympic National Park in Washington, USA. This sanctum was the last remaining shrine to Aeternum, as well as the last location of modern worship of the deity. It collapsed on February 13th, 2025, though the reason for this collapse is currently unknown.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style="text-align: center;">\n<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Addendum 001.1:</strong> Briefing</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Following SCP-001, Foundation communication systems failed globally, severely limiting the ability of unaffected personnel to contact other Foundation sites and verify the status of vital personnel. Two unaffected instances of <a href="/scp-6459">SCP-6459</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference(\'footnote-2\')">2</a></sup> were recovered, allowing rudimentary communications to be established between Foundation sites using pen and paper methods. These communications revealed that approximately 4 Foundation sites globally retained any staff capable of operations. Only one of these sites contained equipment designed to address temporal anomalies, and has since been dedicated entirely to the storage of the highest priority Foundation research and documentation.</p>\n<p>Through these newly established communication efforts, it was discovered that only two members of the O5 council remained. Following a meeting of the remaining members, the decision was made to enact SCP-001 containment procedures as stated and begin research and work into reversing SCP-001.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style="text-align: center;">\n<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Addendum 001.2:</strong> February 13th, 2025\xa00710 hours</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>The following logs were recorded by Foundation Agent Jessie Kidd, shared with Command via <a href="/scp-6459">SCP-6459</a>.

A myriad of snowflakes hang in the air, tousled by an unseen and unfelt wind. I run my hands over a leaf on a tree. It\'s stiff beneath my touch, unmoving. I tug at it slightly, but it refuses to separate from the branch. I frown.</em></p>\n<p><em>The scene is beautiful, a painting of a moment in time. But it\'s one that feels empty, incomplete.</em></p>\n<p><em>I lift my eyepatch, and press two fingers against the wound. It\'s an old wound, to those who still make some attempt at tracking "hours" and "minutes" it would be at least 30 years old by now, but as I pull my fingers away I can see blood left behind. It\'s still fresh, still open. I lower my eyepatch, and leave a simple sigil on a tree nearby. Touching it, I mutter a small incantation. The mark remains dead.</em></p>\n<p><em>It\'s a fool\'s hope, but one I hold onto. Especially now with something beating in my chest.</em></p>\n<p><em>I pull the heart out from under my jacket, and it continues to beat in my hand in defiance of the world around it. This is what we\'ve been working for, what we\'ve been striving for. I press it against the sigil, and in a beat the world around comes back to life.</em></p>\n<p><em>Instinctively, I pull my jacket more securely over myself as a chill in the air I haven\'t felt in god knows how long rushes over me.

My offline records show that much, and that they have some fancy shrine.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Right, you\'re right on top of things.</p>\n<p><em>Cruz thinks, processing the little information it has.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Oh! …<em>Oh</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Aeternum\'s shrine was destroyed, and the world was frozen as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz:</strong> …And with that heart we can fix the shrine. I get it, I get it!</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Do you have any info that gives me an idea of where the shrine actually is?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Hmmm… yes! …Kinda! I didn\'t have a ton of offline records specifically on Aeternum since I don\'t normally get to touch "deific" stuff, but I do have a basic backup of the main Foundation database up to level 3 clearance. Seems the shrine was in the mountains to the northwest of here.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Could you chart a route? Avoid Seattle if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Hm? Well, I guess I can.

It\'s been far too long, have you been well?</p>\n<p><em>I chuckle, my arms held up in surrender.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Agent Saul. I\'ve been better, I gotta say.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I\'d gotten some intel that the Foundation had an operation in this area. Little did I realize it was going to be an old friend.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul raises an eyebrow, his eyes falling on my eyepatch. He approaches me with a stony expression and draws his sword.

Now how in the world did something like this happen?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> You know how I draw those sigils, Saul.

Now, be a good Foundation puppy and start barking.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Quick kick to the back of the knees.

Another shout from Agent Saul tells me he\'s joined.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Left!</p>\n<p><em>My instincts take over. I swing left, and a sword collides with the tree beside me. One of Saul\'s dogs, nipping at my heels.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Any advice is good advice here, Cruz!</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Draw your gun, then!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Those kinda don\'t work, Cruz!

The grunt right behind me fails to turn in time, stumbling and falling over a root.

Eventually I find myself standing on the edge of a ravine.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz, ideas?</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Enough is enough, kid.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul walks from the undergrowth and points his sword at me. Persistent, as always.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Hand whatever it is over. I have no problem tearing you apart for it, and there\'s no hell I can imagine quite like spending eternity as a torso in the woods.</p>\n<p><em>He rushes me. I manage to slide away from him. His strikes at me are powerful, angry, sloppy, and predictable. With a little aid from Cruz I\'m able to dodge his blows.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> What? Not going to fight back? Is that bat on your hip for show, then?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I don\'t want to hurt you.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I sure as hell want to hurt you.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Now, Kidd! Shove him back!</p>\n<p><em>I rush Agent Saul, tackling with my shoulder. The impact sends him rolling to the ground. He tries to rise back to his feet but stumbles back.

Losing his grip on the cliff, he falls into the ravine below. I lunge out in an attempt to grab him again. I overextend in the process, and start tumbling forward.

Let\'s get moving again.</p>\n<p><em>Saul gives on quick glare at the device on my wrist as we start marching again.</em></p>\n<p><em>As we walk, I find myself running my fingers over the leaves and plants. They remain stiff and unmoving as ever beneath my touch. I press my finger against the thorn of a holly bush as we pass by. Pulling my finger away I can see the small prick left on the tip, but nothing else. No sensation, no reactive pain. The same with the snow gathered atop the leaves— there\'s no chill to their touch, nothing at all.</em></p>\n<p><em>I cast my eyes to the sky, seeing two songbirds frozen in place in the air. They\'re twisted around one another, perhaps caught in a mating display of some kind? They hang in place, like a photograph.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Kid, you alright? You\'ve been wandering every which way and it\'s starting to weird me out.</p>\n<p><em>I shrug and keep walking, but he grabs my shoulder and stops me.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> When I talk, you answer me. I\'m getting real tired of you acting all aloof out of nowhere.</p>\n<p><em>I shake his hand off.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I thought it was obvious, is all. How does none of this bother you?</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You\'re kidding me right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I just can\'t move past what we\'ve lost, you know? When I activated that heart for the first time… well…</p>\n<p><em>I look to the snowflakes suspended in air, then back to the tree beside me.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I thought of all the people trapped, how much they deserved to actually <em>feel</em> these things again.</p>\n<p><em>I can feel his eyes on my arm, and watch as they move up to the wound on my face.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You\'re a hypocrite, you know that?</p>\n<p><em>I feel something, almost like an alert going off in my head. I hold a finger to my mouth.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Excuse me? You don\'t get to just <em>shush</em> me—</p>\n<p><em>He\'s cut off as something jabs into my back and knocks me off my feet.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Kidd!</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Detecting several hostiles around us. Humans, for sure. At least five total.</p>\n\n<p><em>I roll to my back. The person who knocked me over jabs a spear into the ground where I was. Rolling back onto my shoulders, I deliver a firm kick into his chest. He stumbles back. Seizing my chance, I hop to my feet and draw my bat.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> A bat?</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You\'re shitting me, kid! You seriously don\'t have a sword?!</p>\n<p><em>We\'re fully surrounded by a group of men at this point. Each bears a series of severe wounds on their bodies, wounds that would most certainly prove fatal in a normal world. They waste no time rushing us. Saul wastes no time meeting them. He kicks a man away with ease and draws his sword. Another attempts to jump him from behind. Saul strikes his chest with the sword\'s base.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Who are these guys anyway?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> We don\'t really have a good name for them. Do you guys?</p>\n<p><em>Saul swings his sword with reckless abandon, knocking one of the men away with its broad side.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> "Annoying", mostly.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Wait so they\'re not—</p>\n\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> No, they\'re not associated with me. They\'re a bunch of freaks who <em>really</em> love the collapse of societal order. They\'re real content with doing whatever the hell they please. Us Keepers are at least interested in <em>trying</em> to have a sense of order.</p>\n<p><em>I swing my bat. It connects with my target\'s stomach.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz, help me out. Escape route, minimal injuries possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Gotcha, on it!</p>\n<p><em>I change my strategy. I dodge and weave through jabs and swings as Cruz calculates. Saul\'s approach is more akin to a hurricane. He strikes with wild sweeping strikes designed to deal as much harm as possible. His blade pierces flesh, maximizing already fatal injuries. His opponents pay them no mind. The assault continues. The men, little more than living corpses, rise back to their feet as quickly as they\'re knocked over.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> …Got it! Bat to the left shoulder of the guy in front of you. Follow it with a shoulder tackle. Then move it!</p>\n<p><em>I bring my bat down on the man\'s shoulder. What I don\'t realize is his existing injury. My bat is the last thing needed to completely remove his arm from his body. The arm flies free.</em></p>\n<p><em>I try to stop, try to freeze and apologize for the damage done, but my body is already in motion. I slam my shoulder against him, and send him toppling over.</em></p>\n<p><em>I can run.</em></p>\n<p><em>I</em> should <em>run. Run and get away, finish the mission. Everything in me screams to move.</em></p>\n<p><em>But I stand in place, staring at the damage done.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You damned fool! Move!</p>\n<p><em>My legs won\'t move.The man is back on his feet. He tackles me to the ground. There\'s a knife pressed to my throat.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> …Please.</p>\n<p><em>My voice comes out as a harsh whisper.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Do it.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul tackles the man off of me, and drags me to my feet. Before I can react we\'re running. He\'s practically dragging me as we run off. Eventually we stop, certain we\'ve left the rogues behind.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Saul, I-</p>\n<p><em>He punches me, hard. I stagger back.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You are a goddamn fool, kid. Time and time again you\'ve shown me that it\'s frankly only by the grace of some higher power that you\'re still able to even move. What is it that you\'re trying to pull, anyway? Some attempt at mercy or something?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I just don\'t want to hurt people if I don\'t have to.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You have a messiah complex or something? Convinced that you\'re the magical lamb set to save the world, eh? Redeem everyone of their sin? Get it through your thick skull. Those men wanted you as close to dead as someone can be in this world for no reason beyond the fact that they could.</p>\n<p><em>He looks away from me, refusing to meet my eyes. I find myself doing the same.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> It\'s not up to me to condemn them. I know what it\'s like to be hurt, Saul, and I damn well know it more than you. When everything is back, the people still with us are going to feel every single thing they\'ve missed since it all stopped. Every single nerve in their body is going to scream out as it comes back to life. I don\'t have the right to give that pain to people. If it means bearing a few injuries… if it means <em>I</em> have to hurt for them, then I\'ll do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …Cruz, where\'s the closest town to here?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> I don\'t need to tell you that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Humor me, I need to make a point.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> …Due east.</p>\n<p><em>Saul grabs my hand.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Follow me.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style="text-align: center;">\n<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Addendum 001.5:</strong> February 13th, 2025\xa00710 hours</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class="blockquote">\n<p><em>Following Cruz\'s instructions, we head into a small suburb near the edge of the forest. It\'s quiet, as any suburb would be in the early morning. That said, the signs of a day in the process of beginning were visible. Children waiting at a bus stop, a man with coffee in his hand fumbling with car keys, a woman walking a dog… everyone in their morning routine. Stuck in that moment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I want you to see exactly what you\'re doing when you choose the coward\'s way out of a fight.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul leads me over to the man fumbling with his keys.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Take a good, long look at the damage done here.</p>\n<p><em>I oblige. I examine the man, and notice a series of fresh wounds across his body. None life-threatening, nothing major, but fresh wounds regardless.</em></p>\n<p><em>I turn to Saul, ready to say… something, but he merely shakes his head and gestures to the rest. My fears are confirmed, every person outside bears similar fresh injuries on their body. Some are small, as if dealt by a hand that was merely curious as to what would happen, while others are deeper, dealt by a hand desperate for satisfaction. Finally I find my voice.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> <em>Why?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You <em>know</em> why, kid. There\'s real evil in the world, and there are people who just <em>pretend</em> they aren\'t evil until the conditions that keep them moral vanish. That\'s all those rogue groups are— people who claimed morality until they got real bored and decided to take it out on everyone else. I spent enough of my time with the Foundation watching as they ignored things like this in favor of restoring their idea of "normalcy". This is what I mean when I say you need to get real already. If someone is trying to kill you, fight back.</p>\n<p><em>He shoves me.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> The fact you\'re ignorant to all of this here says enough. Go ahead and condemn me from on high while you ignore the people down here, you and the rest of the Foundation.</p>\n<p><em>He shoves me again, and I stumble back.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You can go on making promises you can\'t keep to people you don\'t know, or you can wizen the hell up and make the most of the situation you\'re stuck in.</p>\n<p><em>I struggle to respond as I continue to look at the proof around me. If I succeed in the end, if I actually complete this mission, what does it mean for the people here? Suddenly their world starts again, and they scream out from sudden pain they never deserved to feel.</em></p>\n<p><em>But even still…</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Can you really condemn people for lashing out under the worst circumstances that they could possibly be in?</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Ask any man fighting in any war with what they\'re fighting for, and I promise you not a single one can give you a real answer. Hell you could\'ve asked me when I was still Foundation what it was that I believed in, and I\'d just give you a slack-jawed "for humanity" response. The Keepers have made something new from all of that, we\'ve made a proper society. We actually make an effort to deal with the people who do things like this while the Foundation sits on its hands fixating on the past. This?</p>\n<p><em>He throws his arms out in vague motions.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> To you this is hell, I get it. Don\'t act like I don\'t understand your side at all. To me, however? This is <em>freedom</em>. We finally get a world with no pain, no hunger. Those rogues out there are proof that the worst in society cannot and will not change, but here at least when they harm us we don\'t have to feel it. We can go on living. I don\'t get how you can live through all of this and still think that mercy is an option.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz, how close is the nearest shoreline?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Again with this? We\'re going off track again…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Please, Cruz.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Fine. Due west, I\'ll map it out.</p>\n<p><em>I hold out my hand to Saul.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> My turn to show you something.</p>\n<p><em>Following Cruz\'s directions, I lead Agent Saul to the nearest shoreline and out onto the beach. Even slightly before dawn there are a few people out here, clearly outdoorsy types. Some brave enough to have taken off their shoes and dipped their feet into the frigid winter waters, a handful of kids chasing a flock of seagulls, and others simply watching from further up the beach. Another moment caught in time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> What do you hear?</p>\n<p><em>He frowns.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Nothing, obviously. That\'s a stupid question.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Exactly. You <em>should</em> be hearing laughter, the cries of birds, the crashing of waves, but instead it\'s all dead silent.</p>\n<p><em>I throw my arms out.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> This is what I\'m fighting for. I\'m fighting for a chance to <em>have</em> a future. I\'m fighting for <em>this</em>. Moments like this. These moments of joy, of struggle, of sorrow… the things that make us human. I want everyone to have the ability to experience these things in their truest form again. Even you. It isn\'t about me, it never has been. I have the duty to leave a better world for the people who come after me, one where they have the ability to actually have something worth living for.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul is quiet.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> There are really nasty people out there, Saul, I get it. I don\'t blame you for being jaded.</p>\n<p><em>I flash him a weak smile, and walk towards the water itself. Saul follows, almost hesitant. When we reach the shoreline, I step out on top of the waves. The water is solid beneath my feet as I continue walking. Saul is hesitant, but eventually does the same. We both stand atop the water, looking back at the people on the beach.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I\'m willing to give up everything I have if it means everyone else can go on living and experiencing what it means to be alive. What we have now isn\'t that, Saul. What\'s life if people don\'t actually get to <em>feel</em> anything? <em>Experience</em> anything? There isn\'t anything in this world worth living for the way things are now.</p>\n<p><em>Saul stares at me for a moment, then back to the people on the beach.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …Are you trying to convince me or yourself?</p>\n<p><em>I shake my head. I don\'t have an answer that matters. Saul looks as if he wants to say something, but casts his eyes to his feet.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Anything is better than what we have now.</p>\n<p><em>We begin walking back to the beach.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz? Can you get us back on track, please?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Finally! Yes, I can definitely do that.</p>\n\n<p><em>We return to the shore and exit the beach back into the woods.

I never messed with the stuff myself, but there were always rumors of the Foundation using them to basically set everything back to zero.

Running away and avoiding the fight isn\'t always so bad, huh? When you run you\'re always a step ahead. Even if we didn\'t have that ability, though, things would be ok in the end. Humanity can always rebuild. We\'ve done it before, time and time again.</p>\n<p><em>I smile.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> …Things are bad now, but they\'ll get better.

But I—</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I said it before back when we first fell into the ravine.

For the first time in what feels like ages, there\'s a sense of life around us. The community isn\'t large, but the people gathered are</em> alive, <em>moving about in some sense of routine.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> So what is this place, exactly? Some Foundation camp?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> The Foundation has no idea these guys are here.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You never told them?</p>\n<p><em>I shake my head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> These guys found me after that time you took my arm and my eye, if you can even remember.</p>\n<p><em>He furrows his brow, and kicks the ground.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …Yeah, I remember. You\'d raided one of our libraries, and I hunted you down.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I was slower than I should\'ve been, but lesson learned.</p>\n<p><em>I feel his eyes on my right forearm, where my prosthetic once was.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I… should apologize for that, shouldn\'t I?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Probably.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I know.</p>\n<p><em>We stand in silence for a moment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> It\'s because I\'m afraid.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> What is?</p>\n<p><em>He throws his arms out in vague motions.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> All of… <em>this</em>. I joined the Keepers because I\'m afraid. I\'ve lived so much of my life anxious, terrified of what was going to happen tomorrow. When that war broke out it felt like all of my fears were confirmed, and then it all just… stopped. Except me. I kept going.</p>\n<p><em>He looks at me, meeting my eyes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> I felt blessed in a way. I got this one, eternal moment. I don\'t have to worry about tomorrow, because there just isn\'t one anymore. I don\'t have to worry about everyone I love and everything I know vanishing, because they\'re all stuck right here. I feel… like a man actually in control for once, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I\'m scared too.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Really now? You seemed so self-assured.</p>\n<p><em>He playfully punches my shoulder in laughs. The first sincere laugh he\'s had in so long.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Everyone\'s a bit afraid of what comes next, you know? You can\'t ever know the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> So what keeps you going then, Kidd? How do you get past that?</p>\n<p><em>I close my eyes for a moment. When I open them again, I meet his.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Follow me.</p>\n<p><em>I lead him over to a tent, and motion for him to be quiet. Inside is a young woman, cradling an infant in her arms. The baby looks to us with bright, curious eyes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Sorry to bother you, Rio.</p>\n<p><em>The woman shakes her head and smiles. Her baby reaches out a pudgy hand, and I meet it with my finger. The baby wraps its little hand around my fingers. I smile, and after a moment I gently take him from his mother and pass him to Saul. Saul is hesitant, but eventually takes him. He holds the baby as if he was holding a bomb.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I told you before, it\'s not about me. There are things I want back, yeah. I want to hurt, I want to cry, I want feelings to numb deep down. There\'s another part of me, a part of me that wants to do something I\'ll be remembered for before I\'m gone. Death is a foregone conclusion at this point for me, I\'ve made my peace with it. But above all, I know it isn\'t about me and what I want.</p>\n<p><em>Agent Saul watches as the baby reaches out to him. He lets him take hold of his finger, same as I did before.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> He deserves a future too, doesn\'t he? The chance to grow up and make the same mistakes we did?</p>\n<p><em>Saul is silent as the baby holds onto his finger. Finally, he passes the infant back to his mother and we both head back outside.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Do you still have that heart?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> You know I do.</p>\n<p><em>He touches his hand to his chest again.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …Her stitch work really leaves something to be desired, you know. This isn\'t gonna hold up until morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Finally! I have a route prepped that will get us to the shrine. It\'s confirmed clear, and doesn\'t go through Keepers\' territory. The relic is confirmed in good condition. When you\'re both ready, we can head out.</p>\n\n<p><em>I hold my hand out to Saul.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Whatever comes next, it\'ll be ok. It won\'t be a perfect world, but…</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …Anything is better than this.</p>\n<p><em>He shakes my hand, and we head out.</em></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style="text-align: center;">\n<p><span style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Addendum 001.8:</strong> February 13th, 2025\xa00710 hours</span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class="blockquote starfade">\n<p><em>The world didn\'t end instantly. The Shrine of Aeternum had stood neglected and forgotten for years. It wasn\'t one huge, bombastic event that brought it down to the ground. Traditions had changed, customs had changed. New gods had come to replace the old, and those great old churches were replaced by newer, grander ones. The old gods slowly faded as the old stories and rituals that once sustained them stopped getting passed down and were relegated to little more than fairytales.</em></p>\n<p><em>Saul had expected something grand when we crested the hill, signs that some great power had once resided here. Instead we were met with a pile of carved rubble and an overturned, vaguely humanoid statue in the center.</em></p>\n<p><em>I approached the center, drawing the sigil I knew so well. When pressed, it glowed with the faintest light and for a moment I could almost feel the chill of a February morning with it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Cruz, confirm what needs to be done here if you could.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> The shrine itself was actually fairly sturdy all things considered. Likely constructed from anomalous materials to begin with, which is probably why it even lasted as long as it did. You\'ll need to reconstruct the shrine itself first, then insert the heart as a keystone. That should get everything moving again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You\'re sure?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Don\'t question me!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> …And when it\'s done, the Foundation is going to activate their big reset button, yeah?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> More than likely, yes. There\'s enough damage done and enough people who will remember this that it risks a total breach of normalcy. It\'s almost guaranteed that the Foundation is going to have a pretty aggressive amnestics campaign when it\'s all said and done.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …So even if we survive, we\'re just gonna forget it all, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> …Yes. That is the most likely outcome.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> I hope I’ll remember this time together anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Saul and I exchange a glance. There was no hesitation in his eyes anymore. We nod, and get to work rebuilding the shrine. It\'s hard going with only two arms between us, but if there\'s anything we had it was time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> You didn\'t have to come all this way, you know.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> How were you supposed to lift these things on your own? C\'mon now, you\'re definitely too scrawny for construction work.</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Just because I spent my days in research before all of this doesn\'t mean I\'m totally helpless now. I beat you in a fair fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> You had an .aic to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Cruz.aic:</strong> Guilty as charged!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> …You\'ll be ok, Kidd. It\'ll be fine.</p>\n<p><em>I realize just how tense my body has been through this process, and try to ease the tension in my muscles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Right. It\'ll all be fine.</p>\n<p><em>But I can\'t. As we continue working and rebuilding the shrine piece by piece, I feel a rising sense of dread continue to build in my chest.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Hey, take a moment. You don\'t need to put on a brave face right now.</p>\n<p><em>I hear a crack in my voice as I speak.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> …I\'m gonna die.</p>\n<p><em>I had known for a while now that death waited for me here. My injuries were too extreme, and even with Saul here I wouldn\'t be able to get medical aid in time.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Me too.</p>\n<p><em>He looks at me, and there\'s something there. A sparkle in his eyes, something that was never there before.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> But take a look around us for a moment. I can think of worse places to kick the bucket.</p>\n<p><em>And I do. The view down the mountainside into the city below was breathtaking. In the distance you could see the morning sun, still trying so hard to peek over the horizon in the distance.</em></p>\n<p><em>I grab the next stone.</em></p>\n<p><em>We continue working. Together we haul the final stone atop the shrine, and stand before our hard work. All that remains is the keystone, ready to be placed into the chest of the humanoid figure that sat at the center of the shrine.</em></p>\n<p><em>I place my fingers in the wound on Saul\'s chest, and draw the sigil in the hole of the shrine. I remove the heart from my jacket and hold it out to him. It beats with a slow, steady rhythm.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> What are you doing?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Giving it to you.</p>\n<p><em>He takes it in an uncertain hand.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> This is your chance, you know. If you wanted to you could destroy it, and that would be it. You\'d have your eternal moment back.</p>\n<p><em>Saul looks at the heart beating in his hand and smirks.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Maybe I\'m ready for a change.</p>\n<p><em>He inserts the heart into the shrine, and I mutter the incantation.</em></p>\n<p><em>And in a moment, I feel it. Heat from the flames around us, the chill of a cool breeze.</em></p>\n<p><em>And every nerve ending in my body activating. I collapse to the ground in agony as the pain from my all too fresh injuries racks my entire body. Saul drops to his knees as well, but pulls me in close.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Hey, hey, it\'s ok. I\'m right here.</p>\n<p><em>I take sharp, shallow breaths. My first in so long. I feel Saul against me, and finally my body relaxes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> How does it feel?</p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> E-everything hurts. So much. I feel so alive.</p>\n<p><em>He laughs as a tear rolls down his cheek, and I find myself doing the same. He looks up, eyes on the rising sun.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Can\'t believe I let myself miss this for so long.</p>\n<p><em>We\'re both quiet for a moment. A moment, and actual</em> real <em>moment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> …It\'s beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>Another breeze blows, carrying the chirp of a songbird with it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Kidd:</strong> Good morning, Saul.</p>\n<p><strong>Saul:</strong> Good morning, Kidd.</p>\n<p><em>I cry. I cry years and years worth of tears as Saul cradles me, acting as if he isn\'t just as hurt.

In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times.</p>\n<p>Teams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by proximity to the object.</p>\n<p>No personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via written authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver must be escorted by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and must temporarily surrender their rank and security clearance. Following contact, command staff will be escorted at least 5\xa0km from SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. If deemed fit for return to duty by psych staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when quarantine expires.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60\xa0m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.</p>\n<p>Refer to the Mulhausen Report [cross-ref:document00.023.603] for details related to object\'s discovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven personnel. It has also in its time at the facility further furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag chair, three books in an unknown language, four children\'s toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a variety of lab animals including higher primates have failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to produce any effect. Whatever process the subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings is apparently only facilitated by the introduction of living humans.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>view Mulhausen Report docid:00.023.603</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mulhausen Report [00.023.603]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is a brief report detailing the discovery of SCP-002</p>\n<p>Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal where it struck the Earth from orbit. Encased in a shell of thick rock, the fleshy exterior of the object was exposed by the impact. A native farmer happened upon the site and reported his findings to the village elder. Subject gained SCP attention when a Level 4 agent posted in the area detected a small radioactive anomaly generated by the object.</p>\n<p>A collection squad of SCP security personnel led by General Mulhausen was immediately dispatched to the area where they quickly secured the subject in a large container and performed initial testing with subjects recruited from the nearby village. Three men individually sent into the structure subsequently disappeared. Upon discovering this deadly property of the subject, General Mulhausen issued a Level 4a Termination Order of any witnesses (roughly 1/3 of the village) to ensure no outside knowledge of the object and initiated its transport to SCP facility [DATA EXPUNGED].<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring preparation for transport, four SCP security personnel were inexplicably drawn inside the object where they too immediately disappeared. Following inspection, it appeared as if the object had "grown" several new furnishings and was beginning to look like the interior of an apartment room.
